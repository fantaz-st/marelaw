The term "**marine insurance**" refers to the insurance of vessels, cargoes, shipowner's, ship repairer's, and other marine liabilities, and of the various other moveable property and associated interests exposed to the risk incidental to marine transport. It protects the insured against damage, loss, and liability arising from exposure of a vessel, goods, or any moveable property to maritime perils. A contract of marine insurance may cover mixed sea and land, or inland water, risks. A typical example of such a contract is the cargo insurance contract containing the so-called transit clause according to which the insurance covers the goods whilst in transit. The economic function of marine insurance is the financial interests of the participants in the maritime adventure against the adverse consequences of any extraordinary events arising from or in relation to navigation at sea.

There is no international instrument codifying or unifying the law of marine insurance. Marine insurance law, which has developed form law of merchants and mariners, is codified in national statutes. In general, English marine insurance law, including UK Marine Insurance Act 1906, have had a strong influence on the modern development of marine insurance law in rest of the world, primarily because of the global role of the London marine insurance market. Much of the world's marine insurance business transacted in London and is governed expressly or impliedly by English law.  UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 sought to codify the pre-existing common law of marine insurance, and therefore it reflects much of the respective _lex mercatoria_ and _lex maritima_ that had historically entered the common law of marine insurance. For these reasons, it may be safely said that UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 is one of the most significant pieces of legislation in the world. It had important amendments byInsurance Act 2015 introducing changes in respect of disclosure by policyholders, warranties, utmost good faith, and an insurer's remedies for fraudulent claims. The marine insurance, from anEnglish law perspective, still maintains its pre-eminence and historical importance in giving us many of the principles that guide insurance law today.

## Basic marine insurance terminology

**The insured **(also _the assured_ or _the policyholder_) -- the party to the insurance contract who is entitled to enforce the insurer's obligations to provide benefits thereunder. That party is the legal owner of the policy and the person whose material interest us insured.

**The insurer** (also the _underwriter, the assurer, the insurance company_) -- the party of insurance contract who engages to indemnify the insured against any loss or damage covered according to the terms of the contract.

**The subject matter insured** -- anything capable of exposure to maritime perils, and which is subject to maritime insurance coverage. It can be a ship, a consignment of goods, another moveable property, third party liability, freight, passage money, commission, profit, or other benefit, or the security for any advances, loans, or disbursements.

**The premium** -- the consideration paid by the insured to the insurer as a price for insurer's undertaking.

**Sum insured** -- the maximum amount that the insurer is obliged to pay in the event of a claim on the policy. The sum insured is determined in relation to the agreed value or insurable value of the subject matter insured. The criterion for determining the sum insured is the actual value of the subject matter insured. That value can be agreed between parties and specified in the policy as the agreed value. A policy specifying the agreed value is called **valued policy**. A policy which does not specify the value of the subject matter insured, but leaves it to be subsequently ascertained, stating only the sum insured, is **an unvalued policy**. Most marine policies are valued policies.

## Types of marine insurance

- **Hull insurance**

The subject matter of hull insurance is the vessel, including its hull, machinery, equipment, all its parts and appurtenances (anchors, chains, lines, lifeboats, etc.), stores and provisions for the officers and crew, the ordinary fitting requisite for the trade in which the vessel is engaged, engine stores, and bunkers, provided they are belong to insured.

In addition, a standard basic hull insurance policy covers certain shipowner's liabilities for collision as well as vessel's contribution in general average and salvage charges, sue and labour expenses, i.e., the charges properly and reasonably incurred by the insured, their servants, or agents for the measures undertaken to avert or minimize the loss otherwise recoverable under the hull insurance with the object of saving, protecting, or recovering the subject matter insured from the risks covered by the policy.

Hull insurance typically protects the insured against damage, loss, liability, and expenses arising from certain named peril (e.g. perils of the seas, fire, explosion, jettison, piracy, theft, earthquake, lightning, latent defects in the machinery and hull, negligence of master, officers, crew, pilots, repairers, charterers, and barratry).

The principal standard insurance clauses of the London market used for ships in operation are the **1983 Institute Time Clauses-Hulls (ITCH 1983**). Although there are latest revisions of theses clauses, the ITCH 1983 is still the most frequently used standard hull insurance clauses in the world. Similar cover is provided under the American Institute Hull Clauses, in general used for hull insurance in the United States. The Scandinavian market, which is amongst the top five marine insurance markets in the world, uses the Nordic Marine Insurance Plan 2013, currently the version of 2023. The German market uses the DTV -- Standard Terms and Conditions of Insurance for Ocean-Going Vessels 2009 of the German Insurance Association.

Hull policies are usually **valued policies**, meaning that a particular value of the subject matter insured is agreed and specified therein. They are commonly **time policies**, meaning that the insurance covers the vessel during a specified time period, although it is possible to ensure a vessel only for one specific voyage under the terms of a voyage policy.

According to the standard terms of hull insurance, the coverage is usually automatically terminated in the case of a change of the vessel's calcification society, or change, suspension, discontinuance, withdrawal, or expiry of its class, or change in the ownership, flag, management, or bareboat charterer. This is due to the fact that such a change of circumstances represents a material alteration of the risk originally assumed by the insurer.

- **Cargo insurance**

The subject matter of cargo insurance are goods in transport (cargo). The cargo must be indicated in the marine insurance policy with reasonable certainty. The cargo is defined by the relation on which the consignment is transported, the name of the vessel (or vehicle) that will carry the consignment, the planned date of shipment, and any similar information relevant for the marine adventure. A cargo insurance policy indemnifies the seller or the buyer, or the exporter or importer, in the event of loss or damage to goods due to a peril insured against at risk under the policy.

Cargo policies are usually **valued policies**, meaning that a particular value of the subject matter insured is agreed and specified therein. There are several types of cargo insurance contracts frequently used in practice. **An individual contract** covers on specific consignment of goods transported on a designated voyage. The individual policies are usually **voyage policies**, meaning that the insurance covers single consignment on a specified voyage from the port or place of departure to the port or place of destination. **A general contract** covers a larger number of consignments defined in more general terms in favour of the same insured. General policies are usually **time policies**, meaning that insurance is valid during a specific period of time. The most common types of general contracts are floating policy and open cover.

**A floating policy** covers a larger number of consignments for their total value. It usually covers goods of the same type that are delivered successively. Upon delivery of each consignment, the sum is decreased by the amount equal to the value of the respective consignment. The insurance policy is valid until the sum insured is fully exhausted.

**Open cover** insures all consignments of the same insured transported in a defined period. The insurer must declare each consignment to the insurer, including the details of the scope of cover and the sum insured.

The most commonly used standard cargo insurance clauses are the **Institute Cargo Clauses (ICC)**. Their version of 1982 is still most popular worldwide. There are three general sets of ICC -- (A), (B), and (C). The difference is in scope of coverage. ICC (A) provide all risk coverage subject to named exclusions, ICC (B) and ICC (C) are drafted on the bases of named perils. ICC (A) offer the widest and ICC (C) the narrowest coverage. Additionally, war and strike risks can be covered according to the Institute War Clauses (Cargo) and Institute Strikes Clauses (Cargo). Besides these sets of general cargo insurance clauses, there are various specialized cargo clauses intended for to special trades (e.g. coffee, cotton, metals, sugar, wheat etc.).

- **Marine liability Insurance**

The subject matter of marine liability insurance is the civil liability of the insured to a third party incurred, by the reason of maritime perils, by the owner of, or other person interested in or responsible for, a ship, goods, or other movables exposed to maritime perils. Existence of marine liability insurance is related to the development of Protection and Indemnity (P&I) insurance traditionally provided by the P&I clubs. The P&I clubs nowadays still cover the majority of shipowner's liability worldwide.

**P&I clubs** are mutual insurance societies, whereby the members (shipowners) insure one another on an indemnity basis for a variety of third party's liabilities relating to the use and operation of ships. P&I clubs gradually broadened their coverage to include other third party's risks and risks not covered by hull policies, and today they cover virtually all the risks not covered by hull insurance. As the practical and statutory liabilities of shipowners increased, the coverage provided by the P&I clubs extended. In relation to the increase in compulsory insurance, P&I policies began to include "compulsory by law" provision under which liability varies depending on the local law. P&I clubs are non-profit mutual associations. The club members, who are shipowners, demise charterers, and ship operators, collectively share their risks, and are therefore both insurers and insureds. Club's Rules are general terms and conditions of the cover provided, what in commercial insurance is found in the terms of policy. The members' payments as the insurance price to the club are proportionate to the tonnage of the ships they have entered in the club.

With the increase of compulsory by law insurance (Bunkers Convention, Athens Convention 2002, HNS Convention, MLC 2006, etc.) the P&I clubs had to adapt to the situation. Their role is not solely to indemnify the insured according to the insurance contract, but also to act as the shipowner's guarantor towards all potential third party's claims within the scope and limits of liability prescribed by the applicable maritime conventions or national law.

- **Other types of marine insurance**

There are various other types, such as insurance of freight, disbursements, salvage expenses, general average contributions, increased values, loss of hire, war risks, etc.

## Main principles of contract of marine insurance:

Under section 1 of the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 **a contract of marine insurance** is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the assured, in manner and to the extent thereby agreed, against marine losses, that is to say, the losses incident to marine adventure. The insurance conditions or the marine insurance contract are usually included in the insurance policy. The marine insurance contract is a contract of indemnity. The main obligation of the insurer is to indemnify the insured for the loss he suffers in the event of the occurrence of an insured peril within the limits of the sum insured and in accordance with the terms of the contract. The basic principle of marine insurance law is that only a person who has an insurable interest or expects to acquire such an interest can be insured under the policy. A contract of marine insurance is a contract based on the principle of **utmost good faith** (_uberrima fides_). According to Marine Insurance Act 1906, if either party does not observe this principle, the other party may avoid the contract. The Insurance Act 2015 abolishes this rule of law, which allows a party to an insurance contract to challenge the contract because the other party has not acted in good faith. This principle in section 3(1) of the Insurance Act 2015 means the duty to make a "fair presentation of the risk". A fair presentation of the risk for the purposes of the Insurance Act 2015 is one:

_(a) which makes the disclosure required by subsection (4),_

_(b )which makes that disclosure in a manner which would be reasonably clear and accessible to a prudent insurer, and_

_(c) in which every material representation as to a matter of fact is substantially correct, and every material representation as to a matter of expectation or belief is made in good faith._

The disclosure according to Insurance Act 2015 is as follows:

_(a) disclosure of every material circumstance which the insured knows or ought to know, or_

_(b) failing that, disclosure which gives the insurer sufficient information to put a prudent insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquiries for the purpose of revealing those material circumstances._

Special meaning in marine insurance has **a warranty**. Under the Marine Insurance Act 1906 a warranty means a promissory warranty by which the assured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition shall be fulfilled, or whereby the assured affirms or negates the existence of a particular state of facts. An insurance warranty must be strictly and exactly complied with. Upon breach, even it is non-causative or immaterial to the risk, the insurer is automatically discharged from any and all liability as from the date of the breach of warranty. Insurance Act 2015 introduced changes in respect of the insurer's remedy for a breach of warranty. It repeals the provisions of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, and any common law equivalent, which completely discharge the insurer's liability from the time of breach of the warranty. Instead, according to Insurance Act 2015, breach of warranty by the insured suspends the insurer's liability from the time of the breach until the breach is remedied. The insurer will not be liable for any loss which occurs during this period, or which can be attributed to something which occurs during this period. However, the insurer's liability will be reinstated once the breach is remedied (if it can be remedied).

The Marine Insurance Act 1906 implies certain warranties into policies. The most important of these is warranty of seaworthiness of ship according to which in a voyage policy there is an implied warranty that at the commencement of the voyage, the ship should be seaworthy for the purpose of the particular adventure. This can be contrasted with the position under a time policy (which the majority of modern insurance policies are). In time policy, there is no implied warranty that the ship should be seaworthy at any stage; however, if, with the privity of the assured, the ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, the insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to unseaworthiness.

The Insurance Act 2015 changes the law regarding **fraudulent claims** by removing avoidance as a remedy. Where the insured makes a fraudulent claim, Section 12 states that the insurer is not liable to pay that claim and may recover any sums paid to the insured in respect of that claim. The insurer may also treat the contract as having been terminated with effect from the time of the fraudulent act. Where the insurer chooses to do this, it can retain all premiums paid by the insured and will not be liable for any events occurring after the time of the fraudulent act. However, the insurer will still be liable for events occurring before the time of the fraudulent act.

It is the duty of the assured and his agents, in all cases, to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimising a loss. Under the Marine Insurance Act 1906, if the policy contains **a suing and labouring clause**, the assured may recover from the insurer any expenses properly incurred in taking action to avert or mitigate a loss, even if the insurer may have paid for a total loss, or that the subject-matter may have been warranted free from particular average, either wholly or under a certain percentage.

## Types of loss and the measure of indemnity:

It is a basic principle of marine insurance that the insurer is liable only if the loss is a result of the operation of an insured risk. The loss must be proximately caused by the insured risk for the insurer's liability to arise. Loss may be either partial or total: a total loss may be either actual or constructive.

- **Partial loss**

Any loss other than a total loss, as hereinafter defined, is a partial loss.

- **Total loss**

A total loss may be either an actual total loss, or a constructive total loss. Under Marine Insurance Act 1906 where the subject-matter is destroyed, or so damaged as to cease to be a thing of the kind insured, or where the assured is irretrievably deprived thereof, there is **an actual total loss**. **Constructive total loss** is defined as follows: subject to any express provision in the policy, a constructive total loss occurs when the subject-matter is reasonably abandoned because its actual total loss appears unavoidable or because it cannot be saved from actual total loss without incurring an expenditure in excess of its value if the expenditure is incurred. Where the insured elects to abandon the subject-matter insured to the insurer, he must give **a notice of abandonment**, otherwise the loss can only be treated as a partial loss. Where there is a valid abandonment, the insurer is entitled to take over the interest of the assured in whatever may remain of the subject matter insured, and all proprietary rights incidental thereto. There is no particular form of words that must be used for a notice of abandonment, although standard practice has arisen via brokers. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 simply states that Notice of abandonment may be given in writing, or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, and may be given in any terms which indicate the intention of the assured to abandon his insured interest in the subject-matter insured unconditionally to the insurer.

When the insurer has paid a claim in respect of which the insured has rights against a third party, the insurer becomes subrogated to the legal position of the insured and entitled to sue in his own name to assert the right against the third party liable for the loss. Marine Insurance Act 1906 defines **rights of subrogation** as follows:

When the insurer pays for a total loss, either of the whole subject-matter insured or, in the case of goods, any apportionable part of it, the insurer thereupon becomes entitled to take over the interest of the insured in whatever may remain of the subject-matter so paid for. The insurer is thereby subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the insured in and with respect to that subject-matter from the time of the casualty causing the loss
