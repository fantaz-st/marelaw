**General average **is a long-established principle of Maritime law that has existed almost as long as a seaborne traffic. The main principle of GA is that the common adventure consisting of the ship and the cargo is exposed to a peril at sea, the losses and expenses which are intentionally incurred to save the common adventure from the peril shall be shared by the saved interests (shipowner, cargo owner etc.) in proportion to their values.

This principle encourages masters and others to take the best possible action to save the common adventure from danger without regard to the interest sacrificed knowing that the losses will be compensated by all interests. Accordingly, GA is of particular interest to all involved in maritime adventure.

Normally, a loss or damage suffered must be borne by the shipowner or the cargo owner, as the case may be. In reality, of course, the loss is indemnified by the insurer. Where a loss is borne by the owner of the property or his underwriter, such loss is referred to as **a particular average** in maritime law. For example, if a certain type of cargo over-heats during the voyage it may be necessary to sell the cargo at a port other than in destination. In such a case, the cargo owner would himself bear the loss, if any, arising from the sale. However, when a grave peril or danger threatens the whole voyage, and one or several parties make sacrifice or expenditure or suffer loss in order to save the whole voyage and others properties, then those parties whose properties were saved should compensate that loss. This manner of dealing with a loss is known as **general average.** Thus, particular average is a fortuitous partial loss, whereas general average is partial loss that arises out of voluntary act. i.e., deliberate human intervention as distinguished from exposure to an unintended perilous misfortune suffered in the course of maritime adventure.
The most common example of a GA sacrifice is when cargo is jettisoned, i.e., thrown overboard to lighten the ship to prevent or minimise damage that may result from result from the nature or packaging the cargo. Those who benefit from GA act make contributions in proportion to the values of their respective interests -- **general average contributions**. It is based on equitable principle that those interests who benefit from a sacrifice or expenditure made by another interest must contribute towards the loss so suffered to save the common adventure. The process of determining the respective contributions is known as **average adjustment** and is done by professionals called **average adjusters**. It is usually the responsibility of the shipowner to appoint an average adjuster to prepare a general average adjustment.

**To qualify as a general average act, following components must be present:**

- the extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure;
- the act must be voluntary (intentional or deliberate);
- reasonableness;
- the act must have been made in a time of peril;
- common adventure;
- success (the adventure as a whole must be saved);
- causal connection.

The GA act may be in the form of a sacrifice of property or expenditure incurred in an attempt to save a whole adventure. Property, in this context, consists of ship, cargo and freight. GA expenditure may be in connection with sacrifices or incurred independently of sacrifices.

The rules on GA are unified in the York-Antwerp Rules which have been amended a number of times. The first [codification](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)> "Codification (law)") of provisions of general average was the York-Antwerp Rules of 1890. The current version of the Rules is York-Antwerp Rules 2016.

The York-Antwerp Rules are administered by the Committee Maritime International (CMI) and the revisions of the rules are made by CMI. The York-Antwerp Rules are private set of rules, not an international convention. The rules do not apply automatically to a GA act, unlike an international convention would, which, once ratified and enacted into national legislation, applies as a matter of law. The York-Antwerp Rules only apply where they have been specifically incorporated into the contract, for example into a bill of lading or charterparty. Therefore, any new, revised version of the York-Antwerp Rules (such as the recently announced 2016 version) will only apply where the parties so decide and mutually agree to use them instead of a previous version. Almost all bills of lading and charterparties contain a clause making the York-Antwerp Rules applicable as part of the contract. Also, some maritime codes, for example, Maritime Code of Latvia, have enacted the York-Antwerp Rules by a similar reference in the code to York-Antwerp Rules 1994.

**York- Antwerp Rules 2016 consist **of two introductory rules (Rule of Interpretation and Rule Paramount) followed by seven Rules known as lettered Rules which are identified by the letters (from A to G) and 23 Rules, that are identified by numbers (Rule I, Rule II etc.). The lettered Rules set out general principles, and numbered rules contain more detailed provisions. Under paragraph 2 of the Rule of Interpretation the numbered rules have preference over the lettered rules.

CMI has adopted Guidelines relating to GA. Current version is adopted on 2022. These guidelines are prepared for commercial parties to assist their understanding of the practice and basic principles of GA. They do not form part of the York-Antwerp Rules; they are not binding and are not intended to over-ride or alter in any way the provisions of the York-Antwerp Rules, the contracts of carriage or any governing law.

In respect of GA it is recommended for inclusion in contracts for the carriage of goods **''New Jason Clause" which** protects the ship owners in case of damage caused by the negligence of the shipowner or the crew.If the new Jason clause is inserted in the bill of lading cargo owners are obliged to contribute to the general average even the damage was caused by the negligence of the shipowner/carrier or the crew.

When GA is declared, average adjusters will calculate the cost of damages (total amount of the claim) and required contribution by each cargo owner as a percentage based on the commercial value of the cargo owner had on the vessel. The preparation of an adjustment will usually take some time, so that the shipowner will lift his lien in return for satisfactory security. According to Section 2.1. of the CMI Guidelines relating to GA most jurisdictions recognise that the shipowner can exercise a lien (i.e. refuse to allow delivery) on cargo at destination in respect of general average losses sustained by any of the parties to the adventure. Generally, the shipowner or appointed average adjuster will send notices to cargo interests setting out what is required by way of security (the exact procedure may vary slightly according to the jurisdiction(s) involved). The usual security requirements will be as follows:

a. signature by the owner or receiver of the cargo to a General Average Bond (an undertaking that they will pay the contribution legally and properly due in respect of their cargo), and

b. either a cash deposit for an amount estimated by the adjuster to cover likely general average liabilities, usually expressed as a percentage of the invoice value of cargo, or,

if the cargo is insured, it is usual for a General Average Guarantee signed by a reputable insurer to be accepted by the shipowner in place of the cash deposit; the insurer will then take over the handling of the general average aspects of the case through their normal claims' procedures. Both the General Average Bond and General Average Guarantee are distinct contracts in their own right, and may, like any contract, be altered by agreement between the parties.

Marine insurance covers GA claims. For cargo owners who has insurance for their shipments the GA contributions are paid by their insurers. If cargo owner does not have insurance when GA is declared, the contributions need to be paid by cargo owner. The most commonly used standard cargo insurance clauses are the Institute Cargo Clauses (ICC). There are three general sets of ICC -- (A), (B), and (C). All of them fully cover all GA expenses.

In recent year's piracy have caused many problems. Generally, many average adjusters accept that ransom money are allowed in GA in most cases.
