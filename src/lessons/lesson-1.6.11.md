Shipping has been known to be one of the oldest modes of transporting passengers and cargo. Undoubtedly, the notion of stowaways would therefore be as old as the shipping industry.  Moreover, stowaways are an ever-present problem for the shipping industry, in particular to those trading off the coast of West Africa, in Central America, Colombia, Venezuela and in the Dominican Republic. The presence of stowaways on board ships may bring serious consequences for ships and, by extension, to the shipping industry as a whole; the ship could be delayed in port; the repatriation of stowaways can be a very complex and costly procedure involving masters, shipowners, port authorities and agents; and the life of stowaways could be endangered as they may spend several days hidden, with the risk of suffocation and without any water/provisions. Adequate, frequent and well-timed searches minimize the risk of having to deal with a stowaway case and may also save the life of a stowaway who may, for example, be hiding in a place which is subsequently sealed and/or chemically treated.

According to the International Convention Relating to Stowaways (Brussels Convention), 1957, stowaway is defined as a person who is secreted on a ship, or in cargo which is subsequently loaded on the ship, without the consent of the shipowner or the master or any other responsible person and who is detected on board the ship after it has departed from a port, or in the cargo while unloading it in the port of arrival, and is reported as a stowaway by the master to the appropriate authorities.

The International Convention Relating to Stowaways (Brussels Convention), 1957 was the earliest recorded international convention dealing with stowaways. This convention has, however, not been ratified by a sufficient number of states and has not entered in force. In the 2002, the FAL Committee adopted resolution FAL.7(29) to amend the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965 (FAL Convention) by introduction of a new section 4 on Stowaways to include standards and recommended practices for dealing with stowaways. These amendments are the first binding regulations concerning stowaways. The standards and recommended practices for stowaways are based on the Guidelines on the Allocation of Responsibilities to Seek the Successful Resolution of Stowaway Cases (the Guidelines adopted in 1997), which set out the basic principles to be applied in stowaway cases. The 2002 amendments were adopted on 10 January 2002 and came into force on 1 May 2003 by Resolution FAL.7(29). The amendments added new standards and recommended practices for dealing with stowaways and introduced a standard form of stowaway details. The purpose of the amendment to the Annex was to establish and obligate thorough search of ships for stowaways on leaving high-risk ports and tighten the measures for preventing stowaways from hiding on board. The new provisions also recognize and reinforce the rights of stowaways notably by requiring humanitarian principles to be applied when dealing with stowaway cases. Resolution FAL.11(37) adopted on 9 September 2011 accepted the Revised guidelines on the prevention of access by stowaways and the allocation of responsibilities to seek the successful resolution of stowaway cases. The most recent Revised Guidelines are annexed to resolution FAL.13(42) which was adopted on 8 June 2018.

Guidelines recommend application of the basic principles that have been useful in preventing stowaway incidents and have been helpful in the speedy resolution of stowaway cases, as well as preventive measures. According to these Revised Guidelines masters, ship owners, public authorities, port authorities and other stakeholders, including those providing security services ashore, have a responsibility to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in order to prevent stowaway incidents and to resolve stowaway cases expeditiously and secure that an early return or repatriation of the stowaway will take place. Shipowners and masters should ensure that adequate security arrangements are in place which, as far as practicable, will prevent intending stowaways from getting aboard the ship, and, if this fails, as far as practicable, will detect them before the ship leaves port or, at the latest, before it arrives at the next port of call. Fumigation or sealing should not be carried out until a thorough search of the areas to be fumigated or sealed has taken place in order to ensure that no stowaways are present in those areas. States and port and terminal owners, operators and authorities should ensure that the necessary infrastructure, and operational and security arrangements for the purpose of preventing persons attempting to stowaway on board ships from gaining access to port installations and to ships, are established in all their ports, taking into consideration when developing these arrangements, the size of the port, and what type of cargo is shipped from the port.

Revised Guidelines define responsibilities of the master when one finds a stowaway. Firstly, he should make every effort to determine immediately the port of embarkation of the stowaway and to take practical steps to establish the identity, including the nationality/citizenship and the right of residence, of the stowaway. He must notify the existence of a stowaway and any relevant details to the shipowner and appropriate authorities at the port of embarkation, the next port of call and the flag State, with the understanding that when a stowaway declares himself or herself to be a refugee, this information should be treated as confidential to the extent necessary for the security of the stowaway. To ensure confidentiality in these cases no information should be forwarded to authorities public or private in the country of origin or residence of the stowaway. The owner should contact P&I club's managers to decide on future actions. Consequently, the P&I club's correspondent serving the next port of call should be contacted and informed by the club managers. Furthermore, master should not depart from the planned voyage to seek the disembarkation of a stowaway discovered on board the ship after it has left the territorial waters of the State where the stowaways embarked, unless permission to disembark the stowaway has been granted by the public authorities of the State to whose port the ship deviates. Other exemptions are when repatriation has been arranged elsewhere with sufficient documentation and permission given for disembarkation, or unless there are extenuating safety, security, health or compassionate reasons. Finally, the master can depart when attempts to disembark in other ports on the planned voyage have failed and deviation is necessary in order to avoid that the stowaway remain on board for a significant period of time. The master must take appropriate measures to ensure the security, general health, welfare and safety of the stowaway until disembarkation, including providing him or her with adequate provisioning, accommodation, proper medical attention and sanitary facilities. First of all, they should be housed in some part of the crew accommodation which can be locked if necessary. Although stowaways should not be locked in their accommodation when the vessel is at sea and well clear of land if they are considered a threat to the safety of the ship or personnel on board it is advised to lock them in their accommodation. Likewise, they should be locked when the vessel approaches any port or is near the land. In any case, the crew must be on guard of the stowaway's attempts to launch a liferaft or boat in order to reach the land. According to the Guidelines provisions, the mater should have assistance of the ship's flag State while performing actions aforementioned. Upon discovery of the stowaway at the sea, an entry should be made in the Official Log Book recording that information. In addition, any incident involving stowaway should also be recorded in the Official Log Book with full details of the event since this may be used as a part of any report required by owners, the club etc. The stowaway should not be signed on the Crew Agreement and should not be entered on any List of Crew. Contrary to this, a Stowaway List should be made and it should contain all comprehended information regarding the stowaway's identity, nationality or citizenship ready for production to port officials.

The Guidelines prescribe responsibility of the shipowner of the ship on which stowaways are found to comply with any removal directions made by the competent national authorities at the port of disembarkation and to cover any applicable costs relating to the removal, detention, care and disembarkation of the stowaway in accordance with the legislation of the States which may be involved. It is the responsibility of the State of first port of call according to the voyage plan after the discovery of the stowaway to accept the stowaway for examination in accordance with the national laws of that State and, where the competent national authority considers that it would facilitate matters, to allow the shipowner and the competent or appointed P&I Club correspondent to have access to the stowaway. The State of the first port of call should consider allowing disembarkation and provide, as necessary and in accordance with national law, secure accommodation which may be at the expense of the shipowner. Moreover, it should make every effort to cooperate in establishing the validity and authenticity of a stowaway's documents and, when a stowaway has inadequate documents, to whenever practicable and to an extent compatible with national legislation and security requirements issue a covering letter with a photograph of the stowaway and any other important information, or alternatively, a suitable travel document accepted by the public authorities involved. The State of first port of call should give directions for the removal of the stowaway to the port of embarkation, State of nationality/citizenship or right of residence or to some other State to which lawful directions may be made, in cooperation with the shipowner. The State of first port of call should also inform the shipowner on whose ship the stowaway was found, as far as practicable, of the level of cost of detention and return and any additional costs for the documentation of the stowaway, if the shipowner is to cover these costs. The owner's costs associated with the landing of stowaways are usually recoverable from his P&I club, so it is advised for him to collect all evidence of costs relating to the stowaway case, such as fuel, insurance, wages, stores, provisions and port charges in order to support the owner's claim on his P&I policy. If disembarkation is refused, the State of the first port of call must notify the flag State of the ship the reasons for refusing disembarkation.

When the disembarkation of a stowaway has not been possible at the first port of call, it is the responsibility of the State of the subsequent port of call to follow this guidance procedure. Guidelines prescribe responsibility of the State of the original port of embarkation of the stowaway (i.e., the State where the stowaway first boarded the ship) as well. The State of the original port of embarkation must accept any returned stowaway having nationality/citizenship or right of residence. The public authorities of the State of embarkation should not return such stowaways to the State where they were earlier found to be inadmissible. If the attempted stowaway is discovered before sailing either on the ship or in cargo due to be loaded, the State of embarkation should apprehend and detain the attempted stowaway, where permitted by national legislation and refer him to local authorities for prosecution, and/or, where applicable, to the immigration authorities for examination and possible removal. In these cases, no charge and no penalty can't be imposed on the shipowner in respect of detention or removal costs. This rule shall be applied as well in cases where the stowaway is discovered while the ship is still in the territorial waters of the State of the port of his or her embarkation, or in another port in the same State.

According to the Guidelines, the apparent or claimed State of nationality/citizenship of the stowaway and/or of the apparent or claimed State of residence of the stowaway has certain responsibilities, too. The State needs to assist in determining the identity and nationality/citizenship or the rights of residence of the stowaway and to document the stowaway. Where nationality/citizenship or right of residence is established, the State of nationality/citizenship of the stowaway has to accept the stowaway. It is the responsibility of any States of transit during repatriation to allow, subject to normal visa requirements and national security concerns, the transit through their ports and airports of stowaways travelling under the removal instructions or directions of the State of the port of disembarkation.

The resolution of stowaway cases is difficult because of different national legislation in each of the several potentially involved States: The State of embarkation, the State of disembarkation, the flag State of the ship, the State of apparent, claimed or actual nationality/citizenship or right of residence of the stowaway, and States of transit during repatriation. Hence, stowaway incidents should be dealt with in a manner consistent with humanitarian principles.  Each stowaway found should be individually interviewed in order to establish his personal information such as name, date and place of birth, nationality, name and place of birth of either or both stowaway's parents and their postal and residential address. If available, stowaway's passport or seaman's book number with the date and place of issue should also be established. The completed details of the stowaway together with his digital photograph should be communicated to the agent and the P&I club correspondent since this information may enable travel documents to be obtained more quickly on the ship's arrival. Namely, stowaways arriving at or entering a State without the required documents are, in general, illegal entrants and therefore, often, ask asylum. These cases should all be treated in accordance with international protection principles as set out in international instruments, such as the provisions of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and of the United Nations Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967 and relevant national legislation. Due consideration must always be given to the operational safety of the ship and to the safety and well-being of the stowaway.

IMO has organised several seminars in Africa with regard to stowaway problem. The recommendations and conclusions adopted at those seminars on issues not addressed or not sufficiently addressed in any of the IMO instruments resulted in new amendments to the FAL Convention adopted in 2022 which will be in force as from 2024.   A new recommended practice sets out that the stowaways should not receive any payments, or other benefits beyond the minimal requirements to ensure the security, general health, welfare and safety of the stowaways while on board or on shore, as that might act as an incentive to reoffend or as an encouragement to other persons attempting to stowaway on board ships. In addition, the Convention recommends that all cases of stowaways detected in port while attempting to board a ship or ships should be reported to the appropriate port authorities, which will inform all nearby ships. Ships should follow the guidance of the appropriate port and law enforcement authorities. Any procedures should be conducted in such a manner as to cause a minimum of interference and to prevent unnecessary delays to ships.

United States regulate stowaways' procedure within their Refugee Act, 1980. This Act superseded the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 (INA) and raised the annual ceiling for refugees from 17,400 to 50,000. The Act changed the definition of "refugee" to a person with a "well-founded fear of persecution" according to standards established by United Nations conventions and protocols. The Refugee Act made important progress at the time of its passage. It specifically mandated the creation of an asylum application process for persons in the United States or at the border, and it tied U.S. protection to U.N. treaty standards. It also created a new immigration status, now called "asylee," for those who meet the refugee standards. For the first time, asylees were guaranteed family reunification rights, and the act provided asylees a path to a full green card after one year's presence. Asylum protection is available in principle to anyone who demonstrates the requisite risk of persecution in the home country. Refugees and asylum-seekers often travel as stowaways. Under the INA stowaways were summarily excludable and were denied permission to disembark. In those cases, when they were not permitted ashore stowaways essentially become prisoners aboard their vessels and face a high risk of being returned to persecution. Moreover, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) requires from shipowners to provide 24hour armed guards during asylum process. If they not comply to these terms, shipowners might face extremely heavy penalties. On the other hand, the Refugee Act of 1980, obligated the Attorney General to establish a procedure for an alien at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien's status, to apply for asylum, and the alien may be granted asylum in the discretion of the Attorney General. Although stowaway status has been enhanced by the Refugee Act provisions, there is still room for improvement.
