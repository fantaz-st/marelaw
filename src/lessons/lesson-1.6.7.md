## Role of classification societies:

The common mission of the Classification Societies is to contribute to the development and implementation of technical standards for the protection of life, property and the environment in the maritime domain, and they play a fundamental and irreplaceable role in the safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment by providing advice on the construction, operation and maintenance of ships. To this end, they establish and apply technical standards in relation to the design, construction and survey of marine-related facilities, including ships and offshore structures. These standards are issued by the society as published rules.

If a vessel has been properly designed and constructed under the rules of a classification society, it is granted classification, which is evidenced by a class certificate from the classification society. This certificate allows the various actors in the maritime sector (shipowners, charterers, flag state, insurers, crew, port state authorities, etc.) to have a presumption that the ship in question has been properly built, operated and maintained. This is an act of great significance as a ship without class is a marginalized asset in the legal traffic.

Classification in most countries is still not a legal requirement, but one can hardly think of a ship without being classed. SOLAS requires ships to be designed, constructed and maintained in compliance with structural, mechanical and electrical requirements of a recognized classification society. No financial institution will ever finance purchase of a ship that is not classed with one of the societies. A ship without 'class' can neither be insured nor mortgaged. It will be even more difficult to find crew willing to sail on a ship which is not classed. Nobody will risk giving cargo on such a ship and the ship will hardly have any value in charter or sale market.

## Scope of action and specific functions:

A ship to be built in accordance with the Rules of a Classification Society has to undergo several steps, among which include (i) technical review of the plans and other related documents of the ship to be built, and verification of their compliance with the applicable Rules, and (ii) inspection at origin of materials and equipment, as well as (iii) testing the materials during the building of hull, machinery, equipment and, where appropriate, refrigerating machinery.

A large number of plans submitted for review are necessarily modified in many of their structural parameters, thicknesses, reinforcements, configurations and geometry of some of the joints, construction materials, etc. to accommodate to the requirements of the particular Building Rules of the Society in question. Details of the materials used in the construction should be included in all of them.

In the same way and with regard to machinery and propulsion, a series of plans of installations and equipment must be supplied with the details and specifications of the proposed materials. Likewise, plans will also be supplied for other particular installations depending on the type of ship: oil tanker, gas tanker, chemical tanker, passenger ship, etc.

In any case, inspectors regularly visit manufacturers and suppliers to test and inspect key materials and equipment, such as steel plates and other steel laminates, castings, forgings, tubes, valves, boilers, machinery, anchoring equipment, etc.

These tests and inspections are carried out on a sampling basis depending on the type of material or equipment and the requirements of the rules.

If, as a result of the tests, the inspector considers that the values obtained correspond to the requirements for that type of material or equipment contained in the Rules of the society, the inspector will indelibly identify the accepted items and issue a certificate of approval, documents which are collected and recorded in the file prepared for each ship by the society which classifies it.

Among the plans to be supplied with details and material specifications, in respect of installations and equipment, are included: Mooring and anchoring equipment (anchors, chain cables, stays, etc); electrical circuits; Propellers; boilers; general plans for breather and sounding pipes, cargo handling equipment, fuel, etc; service tanks not forming part of the ship's structure, etc.

## Class certificates and their issuance:

Depending on the _Class notations_, the ship is subjected to certain equipment function tests, in the presence of the Classification Society's surveyors, both at the shipyard itself and subsequently in sea trials. In particular, the propulsion machinery is checked to ensure that it functions and performs and that the ship manoeuvres to satisfaction. It is also checked that the auxiliary machinery is capable of providing the essential services for which it is intended. Special attention is also paid to the absence of vibration and noise in the structure of the machinery.

Once it has been verified by means of plan approvals, surveys and tests that the ship complies with the Rules of that particular Classification Society, the _Class Certificate_ is issued.

In this certificate and through the use of a particular symbology and coding of each Society, the _construction marks_ and _notations_ describing its classification are specified. In the case of Lloyd's Register all classed ships are listed with the generic symbols: +100 A1; followed by the description of the type of ship, service routes, and traffic limitations if any.

This is followed by the various class notations, which indicate particular characteristics and properties of the ship covering mandatory items according to international regulations and optional items, in most cases requested by the shipowner.

In any case, this certificate must be kept aboard ship.

## Survey and classification of existing ships:

In the case of ships already built and in service, classification operates in a somewhat different way. In these cases, the shipowner applies for the classification of one of its ships and submits the plans of the ship, which may be either a ship classed by another classification society or a ship which has never been assigned a class.

If the type of ship in question has already been classed or has had its plans certified by a classification society of a similar standard in terms of the application of its rules to the one from which the new classification is requested, the classification process is concluded by a simple survey of the ship in accordance with the guidelines of the new classification society.

Otherwise, a complete survey of the ship's design will be required, by means of an initial classification survey, aimed to confirm that the documents, design of structure and equipment, configuration and technical condition, and operation are in accordance with the specifications of the Classification concerned.

## Maintenance of the class:

Once the ship enters service, in order to maintain Class, the shipowner is obliged to subject the ship to a clearly established program of periodic surveys, carried out on board the ship by the Society's surveyors, to verify that the ship continues to comply with the conditions set out in the Rules.

These programs are based on five-year cycles, with annual inspections, intermediate inspections, and the special or renewal of class inspection, which is carried out at the end of each cycle. Each type of survey has a particular scope and coverage and generally becomes more thorough and rigorous as the ship ages.

In order to facilitate periodic inspections for shipowners, all periodic inspections have a margin (_window_) of three months before and three months after the originally scheduled date.

Regarding the surveys:

- _Annual Survey:_ During the annual surveys the ship is subjected to a general inspection of hull, machinery and equipment following a checklist drawn up with the purpose of verifying that the general condition of the ship meets the requirements of the Rules.
- _Docking survey at approximately 2 yearly intervals:_ the ship is placed in a dry dock in order to check the exterior of the hull and particularly the underwater navigation area, balance keels, plates, intake and discharge gratings, anodes and their fastenings, as well as the rudder, its bearings, stern tube and propeller.
  These inspections are intended to detect areas of knocks, dents, collisions, grounding, corrosion, deformation, cracks, etc. and anything that endangers the structural strength of the submerged hull and steering area.

They are carried out twice in each cycle, the second time during the special inspection phase and no more than 36 months may elapse between the two, which is why the first inspection usually coincides with the intermediate inspection.

- *Intermediate survey:*are carried out between the second and third year and are aimed mainly at verifying the health of the ship's structure. They last longer than the annual inspections and it is quite common that, in order not to hinder the ship's traffic, the inspection plan starts immediately after or coinciding with the second annual inspection and continues throughout the year until the third annual inspection. In some cases, and for the reasons mentioned above, some of the inspections are carried out with the inspector on board while the ship is in transit.
- _Special survey:_ They are carried out every five years with a focus on renewing the Class if suitable. They are carried out following a thorough and extensive programme of structural tests and checks looking for substantial corrosion, cracks and fractures, significant deformations and damage areas. They also include in-depth inspections and tests of key elements of the main machinery, auxiliary engines, steering systems and equipment, loading and unloading systems and anchoring equipment, among others.

They may last up to several weeks, and as with the intermediate inspections, the inspections may begin at the time of the fourth annual inspection and end at the five-year cycle completion date.

## 5-year circle system of continuous survey:

The inspections are carried out continuously over the five-year period, so that the ship is under a system of continuous survey. It is also worth mentioning that in each five-year period, another series of particular inspections are carried out which may coincide with some of the previous ones. For example, the inspections of the tail shaft (propeller shaft), which is carried out once every five-year cycle and which basically consists of removing the shaft separately from the propeller and verifying the absence of cracks, fractures or irregular wear. This type of inspection, due to its particularities, is usually carried out at the same time as the special inspections.

On the other hand, there are other important types of equipment such as boilers, which are also subject to periodic inspections, in this case every two and a half years, and in which great attention is paid to the valves, all the heating surfaces, tubes, etc.

## Non-periodic surveys and repairs and alterations:

There are also a number of so-called non-periodic inspections, as a consequence of situations such as change of owner, change of flag, conversions and transformations of the ship or particular situations such as accidents, groundings, repairs, etc. (damage to the hull, machinery or equipment which may affect the ship's seaworthiness).

## About surveys and surveyors:

In any case, it should be noted that the periodic inspections, whose depth and coverage depend, as mentioned above, on the type, size and age of the ship, are of limited duration, and it would therefore be illusory to expect the inspectors to completely check the entire structure, machinery and equipment of the ship on each visit.

These inspections are carried out on a sampling basis following guidelines based on the Company's experience and expertise, which indicate, for example, those parts of the structure or machinery which may be subject to corrosion, or exposed to high stresses, or are likely to show signs of fatigue or defects and failures.

All classification surveys are carried out by qualified surveyors (marine, machine, welding engineers, etc.), witnessing trials and using mainly visual techniques and sampling techniques. This means, therefore, neither full verification nor monitoring.

It must therefore be stressed that the Classification Rules do not cover every single part of the boat's structure, propulsion equipment or other particularities.

## Statutory functions of classification societies on behalf of flag states:

Classification societies may act both privately (class certificates) and on behalf of states or governments which, for example, do not have their own maritime administration and delegate their inspection functions to them. When Classification Societies act on behalf of states or governments, they issue so-called Statutory Certificates (Certificate issued by or on behalf of a flag State in accordance with the Conventions). When Classification Societies act at the request of shipowners, insurers, etc., the certificates they issue are called "class" certificates.

The Administration can only delegate functions and not responsibilities. It is for this reason that Administrations must find some suitable way to monitor the work of the classification societies.

## Surveys linked to cargoworthiness:

The obligation to maintain the ship in a state of seaworthiness before starting the trip corresponds to the shipowner and is an obligation prescribed in Art. III.1 HVR.

Letter c) of the aforementioned provision includes, as a feature of seaworthiness, what is known as "cargo worthiness", understood as the aptitude of the ship to safely transport the specific cargo contracted.

This obligation is formulated as follows: **the carrier, before starting the voyage, must take diligent care: c) To clean and put in good condition the holds, cold and refrigerated chambers and the other places of the ship, when the goods are loaded for reception, transport and preservation.**

In this regard, the Classification Societies may carry out loading surveys to ensure compliance with the above-mentioned duty.

When convenient, the loading port survey may be combined with periodical survey for classification.
