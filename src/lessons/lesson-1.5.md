**The International Health Regulations 2005** **(IHR)** are alegally binding agreement on 196 countries, including the 194 Member States ofthe World Health Organization (WHO). IHR provide a legal framework that definesthe rights and obligations of the States Parties in handling public healthevents and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders of the state. The stated **purposeand scope of the IHR** are “to prevent, protect against, control and providea public health response to the international spread of disease in ways thatare commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoidunnecessary interference with international traffic and trade”. This binding instrumentof international law entered into force on 15 June 2007.

IHR contain anobligation for each State Party to designate or establish a **National IHR Focal Point** and theauthorities responsible within its respective jurisdiction for theimplementation of health measures under the IHR.

It is theobligation of each State Party according to the IHR to develop, strengthen andmaintain the capacity **to detect, assess,notify and report** events which may constitute a public health emergency ofinternational concern occurring within its territory. The Director-General ofthe WHO shall determine, on the basis of the information received, inparticular from the State Party within whose territory an event is occurring,whether an event constitutes a public health emergency of international concernin accordance with the criteria and the procedure set out in the IHR. If it has been determined that a public healthemergency of international concern is occurring the Director-General of the WHOcan issue the temporary recommendationsor standing recommendationsaccording to the procedure stated in the IHR.

IHR includes specific measures countries can take at ports, airports andground crossings to limit the spread of health risks to other countries, and toprevent unwarranted travel and trade restrictions. Subject to **applicableinternational agreements and relevant articles of these Regulations**, anyState Party may require for public health purposes, on arrival or departure:

(a) with regard totravellers:

(i) information concerning the traveller’s destinationso that the traveller may be contacted;

(ii) information concerning the traveller’s itineraryto ascertain if there was any travel in or near an affected area or otherpossible contacts with infection or contamination prior to arrival, as well asreview of the traveller’s health documents if they are required under

these Regulations; and/or

(iii) anon-invasive medical examination which is the least intrusive examination thatwould achieve the public health objective;

(b) inspection ofbaggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, postal parcels and human remains.

IHR contain the special provisionsfor conveyance and conveyance operators, for ships crossing State Partyterritory in transit, the procedure with conveyance affected by infection andcontamination, and procedure for entering into port of the State Party. States Parties shall ensure that **ShipSanitation Control Exemption Certificates** (SSCEC) and **Ship Sanitation Control Certificates** (SSCC) are issued at its portsaccording to the model provided in Annex 3 the IHR. **The Maritime Declarationof Health (MDH)** is another documentrequired by the IHR, and it is a document containing data related to thestate of health on board a ship during passage and on arrival at port. The MDHModel with Attachment is contained as Annex No.8 of the IHR. TheMDH is the basic document containing the data required by port healthauthorities relating to the state of health on board a ship during the voyageand on arrival at a port also required by the Convention on Facilitation ofInternational Maritime Traffic, 1965 (FAL). Wheneverpossible, control measures shall be carried out when the ship and holds areempty. In the case of a ship in ballast, they shall be carried out beforeloading.

Guidance for preparing and performing ship inspection, completing the certificatesand applying public health measures within the framework of IHR is provided inthe Handbook for Inspection of Ships and Issuance of Ship SanitationCertificates provides, issued by WHO.
