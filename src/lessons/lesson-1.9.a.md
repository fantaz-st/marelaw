National maritime law regulations in the Republic of Croatia are aligned with the most important international legal instruments. In addition, during the process of accession to the European Union, the Republic of Croatia aligned its national legislation with the acquis communautaire in the field of maritime transport.

The fundamental maritime law regulation in the Republic of Croatia is the Maritime Code adopted in 2004. In addition to it, Croatia has implemented a comprehensive set of laws and regulations that collectively govern maritime activities.

## Maritime Code

The currently valid text of the Maritime Code was adopted in 2004, and has been amended and supplemented several times (2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2019). The Maritime Code is divided into twelve parts and regulates all significant public law and property law relations related to the sea, maritime navigation activities and maritime vessels.

Provisions of the Maritime Code establish the maritime and submarine areas of the Republic of Croatia and determine legal relations in them, the safety of navigation in the internal waters and the territorial sea of the Republic of Croatia, protection and preservation of natural maritime resources and the maritime environment, the basic substantive legal relations pertaining to waterborne craft, contractual and other obligatory relations concerning ships, procedures concerning the registration of waterborne craft, limitations of the ship operator's liability, distrainment and security measures on ships.

Unless otherwise stipulated by this Code its provisions shall apply to waterborne craft located or navigating in the internal waters and the territorial sea of the Republic of Croatia. Provisions of this Code shall apply to warships solely when explicitly stipulated by this Code. Unless otherwise stipulated by this Code its provisions pertaining to ships under construction shall also apply to other waterborne crafts under construction. According to provisions of Croatian Maritime code ship under construction encompasses shipbuilding from the moment of laying the keel or a similar activity in shipbuilding up to the time of its entering into the register of ships.

Croatian Maritime Code prescribes that in cases of maritime law relations not established by this Code, other regulations adopted based on this Code or other acts, common practice shall apply.

Croatian Maritime Code comprises definitions of all important maritime terms. For example, it defines maritime craft as a craft intended for navigation at sea (waterborne craft) or a craft permanently moored or anchored at sea (floating facility) i.e., an object entirely or partially embedded into the seabed or positioned onto the seabed (fixed offshore facility). Furthermore, according to provisions of Croatian Maritime Code, waterborne craft is a maritime craft intended for navigation at sea. A waterborne craft may be a ship, warship, yacht or boat. Ship, with the exception of warship, is any waterborne craft intended for navigation at sea, exceeding 15 min length or one authorised to carry more than 12 passengers. A ship may be a passenger, cargo or technical waterborne craft, or a fishing, public or a scientific research ship. Croatian warship, on the other hand, is defined as a waterborne craft, including submarines, which is under the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia, and the crew of which is military, i.e., under the authority of military discipline, which must furthermore display external recognition signs of Croatian national warships whenever it is necessary to identify this feature of the craft.

## Another relevant legislature

Besides Maritime code, the other important legal sources of maritime law in the Republic of Croatia are:

## Act on Maritime Domain and Seaports

According to the Maritime Domain and Sea Ports Act, maritime domain is the general property of interest to the Republic of Croatia, it enjoys unparalleled special protection and it represents the common good for general use. The components and boundaries of the maritime domain are defined by Maritime Domain and Seaports Act, which states that the maritime domain comprises: internal waters and territorial sea, their seabed, subsoil, and undersea; and part of the land which is by its nature intended for general use and which is designated as such, as well as everything that is permanently connected with this part of the land on the surface or below it, and are real estates that are by their natural features, appearance, purpose, position, and manner of use.
