###Definitions

**International voyage** stands for any voyage by sea from a signatory country to a port outside this country or inversely.

**Fishing ship** refers to ships used to catch fish, whales, seals, walruses or other living resource of the sea.

**Length (L)** shall be taken as 96% of the total length on a waterline at 85 per cent of the least moulded depth measured at the top pf the keel.

**Amidships** is at middle of the length (L).

**Breadth (B)** is the maximum breadth measured amidships to the moulded line of the frame in a ship with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other material.

**Moulded depth** is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side.

**Depth for Freeboard (D)** is the moulded depth amidships plus the thickness of the freeboard deck stringer plate, where fitted, plus **T(L-S)/L**, if the exposed freeboard deck is sheathed:

\- T is the mean thickness of the exposed sheathing clear of openings and
\- S is the total length of superstructures

**Block coefficient (Cb)** is the volume of moulded displacement of the ship, divided by the volume of length, breadth and moulded depth, excluding bossing, in a metal shell ship and the volume of displacement of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other material.

**Freeboard** assigned is the vertical distance amidships from the upper edge of the deck line to the upper edge of the related load line.

**Freeboard deck** is the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of closing all openings in the weather part and below which all openings in the sides of the ship are fitted with permanent watertight closing.

**Superstructure** is a decked structure on the freeboard deck, from side to side or with side plating not being inboard more than 4% of B.

**Flush deck Ship** is one ship with no superstructure on the freeboard deck.

**Weathertight** means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the ship.

###Application

This convention will be applied to all ships engaged in international voyages excepted the ships of war, the ships of less than 24 meters in length, ships of less than 150 gross tonnage, pleasure yachts not engaged in trade and fishing vessels.

Nothing shall apply to ships solely navigating in the Great Lakes of North America and the River St. Lawrence as far as East as a rhumb line from Cap des Rosiers to West Point and the Anticosti Island, the Caspian Sea and the Plate, Paraná and Uruguay rivers as far as East as a rhumb line between Punta Norte and Punta el Este.

###Zones and regions

A ship placed in an area or zone, described in annex II, is obliged to comply with the applicable limitations described in it. A port placed in the boundary of two regions or zones, will be considered placed in the region where is coming or where she goes.

###Submersion

Load lines marked in the ship side, corresponding to a season, area, zone or region; in which the ship is placed, cannot be submerged in no time. When a ship is leaving from a fresh water port, deeper loading is permitted corresponding to the weight of bunker and all other materials to be consumed before the arrival to sea.

###Initial and periodical, Surveys and Inspections

A ship shall be subjected to the surveys and inspections, specified below:

\- A complete survey before the entrance in service of her structure and equipment; of everything related with this convention
\- A periodic survey at least once every five years, to check the state of the structure, equipment, devices and materials; of the ship.
\- A yearly inspection, to check no modification of hull or superstructure, has been done, specially:
\- Protection of openings;
\- Guard rails;
\- Freeing ports;
\- Means of access to crew’s quarters

After those inspections has been done, it will be no possible to modify any item, without the administration authorization.

###Issue of Certificates

Any ship that has been surveyed and marked in accordance to this convention, will receive an **International Load Line Certificate** (1966).

###Form of certificates

The certificates shall be drawn up in the official language or languages of the issuing country with a translation to English or French, if the language is other.

The form of the certificates shall be that of the models given in Annex III of the Convention. The arrangement of the printed part of each model certificate shall be exactly reproduced in any certificates issued, and in any certified copies thereof.

###Duration of Certificates

An International Load Line Certificate (1966) shall be issued for a period specified by the Administration, which shall not exceed five years from the date of issue. If a new certificate cannot be issued before the expiry date, the organization carrying out the survey may extend the validity for a period which shall not exceed five months

A certificate issued to a ship by an Administration shall cease to be valid upon the transfer of such a ship to the flag of another State.

###Annex I. Regulations for determining Load Lines

The Regulations assume that that the nature and stowage of the cargo, ballast, etc. are such as to secure sufficient stability of the ship and the avoidance of excessive structural stress.

###Strength of hull

General structural strength of the hull shall be sufficient for the draft corresponding to the freeboard assigned.

Ships with mechanical means of propulsion, lighters or barges shall be assigned freeboards in accordance to the provisions of Regulations 1 to 40 in the Annex I, ships carrying timber deck cargoes may be assigned in addition to the previous regulations, timber freeboards in accordance to Regulations 41 to 45. Ships designed to carry sail and tugs; shall be assigned freeboards in accordance to the provisions of Regulations 1 to 40 in the Annex I.

###Deck Line

is a horizontal line meeting the following requirements:

- 300 mm in length
- 25 mm in breadth
- marked amidships in both sides
- its upper edge passes through the point where the continuation of upper surface of the freeboard deck intersects the outer surface of the shell.

###Load line mark

shall consist of a ring of 300 millimetres (12 inches) in outside diameter and 25 millimetres (1 inch) wide which is intersected by a horizontal line 450 millimetres (18 inches) in length and 25 millimetres (1 inch) in breadth, the upper edge of which passes through the centre of the ring. The centre of the ring is placed amidships and at a vertical distance from the assigned summer freeboard to the upper edge of the deck line.

The lines detailed in the image which indicate the Load line assigned, shall be horizontal lines 230 millimetres (9 inches) in length and 25 millimetres (1 inch) in breadth which extend forward of and at right angles to, a vertical line 25 millimetres (1 inch) in breadth marked at a distance 540 millimetres (21 inches) forward of the centre of the ring.

The following Load lines shall be used:

\- the Summer Load Line indicated by the upper edge of the line which passes through the centre of the ring and also by a line marked S.

\- the Winter Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked W.

\- the Winter North Atlantic Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked WNA.

\- the Tropical Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked T.

\- the Fresh Water Load Line in summer indicated by the upper edge of a line marked F. The Fresh Water Load Line in summer is marked abaft the vertical line. The difference between the Fresh Water Load Line in summer and the Summer Load Line is the allowance to be made for Loading in fresh water at the other Load lines.

\- the Tropical Fresh Water Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked TF, and marked abaft the vertical line.

If timber freeboards are assigned, the timber Load lines shall be marked in addition to ordinary Load lines. They will be marked adding a L (lumber).

###Details of marking

The ring, lines and letters shall be painted in white or yellow on a dark ground or in black on a light ground. They shall also be permanently marked on the sides of the ships to the satisfaction of the Administration.

###Chapter III. Freeboards

For the purposes of freeboard computation, ships shall be divided into Type A and Type B.

**Type "A"** ship is one which is designed to carry only liquid cargoes in bulk, which cargo tanks have only small access openings closed by watertight gasketed covers of steel or equivalent material. Hen such a ship necessarily has high integrity of the exposed deck; and high degree of safety against flooding.

Type "A" ship shall be assigned a freeboard not less than that based on Table A of Regulation 28.

Other corrections considered within the Convention are to be applied for ships of less than 100 metres in length, for Block Coefficient, Depth and length of superstructures or sagging. A minimum Bow height, higher than the tabulated freeboard of the ship is determined.

###Minimum freeboards

\- summer freeboard is obtained from table in rule 28, having applied the established corrections (Regulations 27 as applicable, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37, 38 and, if applicable, 39).

\- winter freeboard shall be obtained adding the summer freeboard the one forty-eighth of the summer freeboard.

\- winter North Atlantic freeboard shall be obtained adding 50 millimetres or 2” the winter freeboard, and shall be only applicable to ships less than 100 metres in length.

\- tropical freeboard, shall be obtained deducting the summer freeboard the one forty-eighth of the summer freeboard.

\- fresh Water freeboard in unit density shall be obtained by deducting from the minimum freeboard in salt water, dividing the summer Displacement by 40T centimetres (inches), (T = tons per centimetre (inch) immersion in salt water at the summer Load waterline).

\- tropical Fresh Water freeboard in unit density shall be obtained by deducting the Fresh Water freeboard the one forty-eighth of the summer freeboard.

###ANNEX II

Zones, areas and seasonal periods

Summer, maximum 10 per cent winds of force 8 Beaufort (34 knots) or more.
