## Introduction

- A port of Refuge is a port or place that the vessel diverts to when her master considers it is unsafe to continue the voyage due to peril that threatens the "common safety" (i.e.: a dangerous ingress of water into a vessel, a dangerous shift of cargo, the vessel adopts an angle of loll, there is a serious fire on board etc.).
- When such a deviation is made for the preservation from peril of property involved in a common maritime adventure, it will usually constitute a general average act and the costs of the deviation to stay at the port of refuge in general average.

## Procedures to be followed for a ship calling a port of refuge

- to inform the agents in the port of refuge, the ship's requirements (spares, bunkers, and others, if the vessel has shifting cargo, vessel may require stevedores and barges).
- to record ship's position, to keep accurate records of all events and expenditure.
- to inform the agent to intimate the port authority, pilot, P&I Club surveyor, Immigration, Customs, Port health etc.
- saved to be given salvor's security.
- to obtain health clearances.
- to enter the vessel "under average"
- On port arrival, inform owner and charterer, who will declare general average.
- to write the Note protest as soon as possible.
- to notify insurance agent if there is hull and machinery damage.
- to notify Classification society.
- to inform P&I Club if cargo damage is suspected,
- if the voyage is terminated, General Average Guarantee should be provided.
- to arrange cargo discharge, trans-shipment or ware-housing of cargo.

Once at berth:

- The Class Surveyor will inspect the damage area and will recommend repairs. For this, the cargo may have to be shifted; stages may be rigged inside and outside and, in some cases, vessel may require dry-docking.
- On receiving the list of repairs from the class surveyor a tender document is prepared with the company's representative and the underwriter surveyor, if any.
- The tender document is prepared in two parts. First part is for the technical bid and the second part is for the price bid. In the technical bid part, the repairing workshop shows:

1. Eligibility to repair,
2. Competence to repair,
3. Proper facilities at the workshop to repair by providing evidences of previous experiences of similar repairs.

- For preparing the price bid, the workshop representative will visit the ship and inspect the sight of repair. By particular time and date, the tendered document will be submitted to the ship.
- The technical bid will open first and the competent workshop will be shortlisted. The price bid of the shortlisted workshop will then be opened, lowest bid will be accepted, keeping in mind that more efficient work in sorter time is preferable.
- The contract of repairs will then be signed with the selected workshop. The contractor should include a demurrage clause in which the daily rate of demurrage and pro-rata should be stated. The recommended repairs will then be carried out under the supervision of class surveyors.
- On satisfactory completion of the repairs the class surveyor will issue an "Interim Certificate of Class" to await the final certificate.
- The disbursement of port is paid through the agent after which the master will extend the protest.
- Copies of all documents will be transmitted to the owner and the vessel will obtain port clearance, proceed out to sea and resume the course.
- To make appropriate log book entries.

## Objectives of providing a place of refuge

- Provisions of SAR Convention should be followed, when the safety of life is involved. When the ship needs assistance but no safety of life is involved, the present guidelines should be followed.
- The issue of "places of refuge" is a solution to the practical problem if a ship in serious difficulty, should be brought into shelter near the coast or into a port or should it be taken out to sea.
- When a ship involved in an incident, which is the best way of preventing damage or pollution from its progressive deterioration would be to lighten its cargo and bunkers; and to repair the damage. Maybe in a place of refuge.
- However, to bring the ship into a place of refuge near a coast, may endanger it and local authorities may object to the operation, but in the other hand; it is rarely possible to deal safely and effectively with a marine casualty in open sea conditions.
- In some circumstances, the longer a damaged ship, remains at the mercy of the elements in the open sea, the greater the risk of the vessel's deterioration.
- Therefore, the access of place of refuge could involve a political decision, based on the balance between the advantage for the affected ship and the risk to the environment resulting from the ship being near the coast.

## Background

It will be usually advantageous to take the ship to a place of refuge, in order to transfer the cargo or bunkers, to prevent or minimize damage or pollution, but additionally there is the advantage of limiting the extent of coastline threatened by damage or pollution. The use of a place of refuge could encounter local and political opposition.

## Purpose

These guidelines have the purpose to provide Member Governments, shipmasters, companies and salvors a frame to collaborate in a complementary way.

It should be made clear that these guidelines do not address the issue of operations to rescue persons at sea; however, two situations may arise:

- The ship is in need of assistance but not in a distress situation that requires the evacuation of those on board; or
- The crew has been rescued, except those staying on board in an attempt to deal with the situation of the ship.

In any case, if in an evolving situation, the persons on board, find themselves in distress, the rules applicable to rescue operations are the SAR Convention, IAMSAR and documents arising therefrom; have priority over the places of refuge guidelines.

The competent MRCC should be informed about any situation, which may develop into a SAR incident, and the safety of the persons must be constantly borne in mind, particularly when:

- A ship poses a risk to the life of persons in the vicinity
- If persons voluntarily stay or go on board to attempt to overcome the difficulties experienced by the ship.

## Definitions

**Ship in need of assistance** means a ship in situation, apart from one requiring rescue of persons on board, that could give rise to loss of the vessel or a navigational or environmental, hazard.

**Place of refuge** means a place where a ship in need of assistance, can take action to enable it to stabilize its condition and reduce the hazards to navigation, and to protect human life and the environment.

**MAS** means a maritime assistance service, based on resolution A.950(23), responsible for receiving reports in the event of incidents and serving as the point of contact between the shipmaster and the authorities of the coastal state

## Guidelines for action required of masters and/or salvors of ships in need of a place of refuge

The Master should with the assistance of the company and the salvor, to appraise the situation and identify the reasons for assistance.

When identifying hazards and assessing the associated risks, the master should estimate the consequences of a possible casualty, taking into account the factors available for assessing casualty and the cargo and bunkers on board if the ship remains in the same position, continues its voyage, reaches a place of refuge or is taken out to sea.

Establishment of responsibilities and communications with all parties involved, the Master and/or salvor should identify the assistance they require from the coastal State in order to overcome the inherent danger of the situation, transmitting the particulars before mentioned and through the coastal State's Maritime Assistance Service (MAS)

Response actions, the Master, company and salvors when applicable, should comply with the practical requirements, resulting from the coastal State's decision-making process.

## Guidelines for actions expected of coastal states:

Coastal States may require the ship's master or company, to take appropriate action in time limit to halting a threat of danger. The coastal States should establish procedures and in particular a Maritime Assistance Service (MAS)

Assessment of places of refuge, Maritime authorities should carry out an objective analysis for each place of refuge of the advantages and disadvantages of allowing a ship in need of assistance to proceed to a place of refuge, taking into account a list of factors set out below. This should take the form of contingency plans and an appropriate system for information sharing for establishing communications and alert procedures

Analysis factors

- Seaworthiness, of the ship concerned;
- Nature and condition of cargo, stores and bunkers;
- Distance and estimated transit time to a place of refuge;
- Whether the Master is still on board;
- The number of persons on board and assessment on them;
- Legal authority;
- Ship's insurance, company and limits of liability;
- Agreement to the proposal of coastal state to proceed to a place of refuge;
- Provisions of the financial security;
- Commercial salvage contracts;
- Information on the intention of ship;
- Designation of a representative of the company at the coastal State concerned;
- Risk evaluation factors;
- Any measures already taken

Expert analysis, an inspection team designated by the coastal State, should board the ship for gathering evaluation data. The analysis should include a comparison between the risk involved if the ship remains at sea and the ones that it would pose to the place of refuge and its environment. Such comparison should cover the following points:

- Safeguarding of human life at sea;
- Safety of persons at the place of refuge and its environment;
- Risk of pollution;
- If the place of refuge is a port, risk of disruption to port's operations;
- Evaluation of the consequences of a place of refuge refusal;
- Due regards when drawing the analysis to the preservation of ship's structure.

Decision-making process for the use of a place of refuge, when permission to access the place of refuge is requested, there is no obligation for the coastal State, to grant it. The decision to allow it or refuse admittance can be coupled with practical requirements. Finally, the action of the coastal State, do not prevent the company or its representative from being called upon to take steps with a view to arranging for the ship in need of assistance to proceed to a place of refuge.

In any case, if the coastal State is not obliged to give access to a ship into a national place of refuge, it is compulsory to have contingency plans with this purpose.
