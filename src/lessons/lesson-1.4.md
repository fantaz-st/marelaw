**The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), **adopted by the IMO in 1973, is an international instrument for the **prevention and minimizing of operational and accidental pollution of the marine environment by ships**.

MARPOL includes **six Annexes**:

1. **Annex I Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil** (entered into force 2 October 1983);
2. **Annex II Regulations for the Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk** (entered into force 2 October 1983, provisions took effect from 6 April 1987);
3. **Annex III Prevention of Pollution by Harmful Substances Carried by Sea in Packaged Form** (entered into force 1 July 1992);
4. **Annex IV Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships** (entered into force 27 September 2003);
5. **Annex V Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships** (entered into force 31 December 1988);
6. **Annex VI Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships** (entered into force 19 May 2005).

**A pollution incident **within the meaning of MARPOL is a discharge or potential discharge above the permitted limits.

**Special areas **within the meaning of MARPOL are areas where, for technical reasons related to their oceanographic and environmental characteristics and heavy maritime traffic, the application of special mandatory pollution prevention methods, i.e. a higher level of protection, is required. Special Areas with strict controls on operational discharges are included in most Annexes.

More on **Special area** at:

<https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Special-Areas-Marpol.aspx>

## 1. Annex I Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil

The aim of Annex I is to prevent operational and accidental pollution of the marine environment by oil. It includes various preventive measures such as requirements for the construction and operation of tankers. For example, all new tankers should have double hulls, bilge water should only be discharged via the oily water separator, and oily water from the cargo tanks should only be discharged via the oil discharge and monitoring system and crude oil washing should be applied.

More on **double hull** at:

<https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/constructionrequirements.aspx>

**Oily water is water in which oil content of the effluent without dilution does exceed 15 ppm.**

**Crude oil washing (COW) **is a measure to prevent the operational pollution of oil tankers. The tanks are cleaned with crude oil. COW was made mandatory for new tankers by the 1978 Protocol to the MARPOL Convention, and in 1999 the IMO adopted revised specifications for COW.  Regulation 33 of MARPOL Annex I require _every new crude oil tanker of 20,000 tons deadweight and above to be fitted with a cargo tank cleaning system using crude oil washing_.

More on **COW** at:

<http://www.marpoltraining.com/MMSKOREAN/MARPOL/Annex_I/r33.htm>

<https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Crude-Oil-Washing.aspx>

All oil tankers of 150 gross tonnage and above and all other ships of 400 gross tonnage and above should hold an **International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate** (IOPPC) after an initial or renewal survey in accordance with Regulation 6 of Annex I. The certificate may be issued either by the administration or by a duly authorized person or organization, for a maximum period of five years.

## 2. Annex II Regulations for the Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk

Carriage of chemicals in bulk is covered by regulations in **SOLAS Chapter VII - Carriage of dangerous goods** and MARPOL Annex II - Regulations for the Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk.

The aim of **Annex II** is to control pollution by noxious liquid substances (NLS) in bulk. It categorize noxious and liquid substances into the following categories:

**Category X**: if discharged into the sea present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health and whose discharge into the marine environment is therefore prohibited,

**Category Y**: _if discharged into the sea present a hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea a limitation on the quality and quantity of the discharge into the marine environment_,

**Category Z**: _if discharged into the sea present a minor hazard to either marine resources or human health and therefore justify less stringent restrictions on the quality and quantity of the discharge into the marine environment_; and

**Other Substances**: _substances which have been evaluated and found to fall outside Category X, Y or Z because they are considered to present no harm to marine resources, human health, or other legitimate uses of the sea when discharged into the sea._

More on Annex II:

<https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/ChemicalPollution-Default.aspx>

**An International Pollution Prevention Certificate for the Carriage of Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk **shall be issued**, **after an initial or renewal survey to any ship carry NLS in bulk. It should be issued for a period specified by the Administration which shall not exceed 5 years.

## 3. Annex III Prevention of Pollution by Harmful Substances Carried by Sea in Packaged Form

Harmful Substances Carried by sea in packaged form are regulated by **SOLAS Chapter VII - Carriage of Dangerous Goods **and MARPOL Annex III. SOLAS Chapter VII - Carriage of Dangerous Goods prescribes the _classification, packaging, marking, labelling and placarding, documentation and stowage of chemicals carried in packaged form_.

The aim of Annex III is to prevent pollution by harmful substances in packaged form. The harmful substances are substances that are identified as marine pollutants in **International Maritime Dangerous Goods code (IMDG)**. It gives general requirements for the _issuing of detailed standards on packing, marking, labelling, documentation, stowage, quantity limitations, exceptions and notifications for preventing pollution by harmful substances_.

The **IMDG Code** is an international code for the transportation of dangerous goods in packaged form to ensure the safety of crew and ship and to prevent pollution. It contains regulations for each individual substance, material or article relating to packaging, container traffic and stowage issues, in particular the segregation of incompatible substances.

## 4. Annex IV Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships

The purpose of **Annex IV** is to prevent pollution by sewage form ships. It prescribes measures for _discharge of sewage into the sea from ships, including regulations regarding the ships' equipment and systems for the control of sewage discharge, the provision of port reception facilities for sewage, and requirements for survey and certification_.

The **sewage** includes drainage and other wastes from any form of toilets and urinals, medical premises, spaces containing living animals or other waste waters when mixed with the drainages defined above.

The Annex is applied to ships engaged in international voyages, of 400 gross tonnage and above or which are certified to carry more than 15 persons. The ships should be equipped with either an approved **sewage treatment plant** or an approved **sewage comminuting and disinfecting system** or a **sewage holding tank**.

The **discharge of sewage** into the sea is prohibited, except when the ship has in operation an approved sewage treatment plant or when the ship is discharging comminuted and disinfected sewage using an approved system at a distance of more than **three nautical miles** **from the nearest land**. Sewage which is not comminuted or disinfected may be discharged at a distance of more than **12 nautical miles from the nearest land** when the ship is en route and proceeding at not less than 4 knots, and the approved rate of discharge of untreated sewage.

The discharge of sewage from passenger ships within a Special Area is prohibited. The only special area nowadays according to the Annex IV is Baltic sea.

After an initial or renewal survey to any ship within the scope of Annex IV **International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate** will be issued for a period which shall not exceed five years.
