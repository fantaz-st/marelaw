**Hague-Visby Rules**

The most important international convention governing carriage of goods by sea are The Hague Rules. The Hague Rules were adopted in 1924, the Hague-Visby Rules in 1968 and 1979 and the Hamburg Rules in 1978. While the Hamburg Rules are in force in about twenty-six countries, the Hague Rules or the Hague-Visby Rules are presently in force in most of the world's shipping nations. The Visby Rules (the Brussels Protocol of 1968 amending the Brussels Convention of 1924) were the outcome of the successful deliberations of the Comité Maritime International Conference in Stockholm in 1963, where changes to the Brussels Convention of 1924 were adopted. The Visby Rules (the Brussels Protocol of February 23, 1968) should not be considered a separate convention, as they are amendments to the Brussels Convention of 1924. Article 6 of the Protocol stipulates: "As between the Parties to this Protocol, the Convention and the Protocol shall be read and interpreted together as one single instrument. A Party to this Protocol shall have no duty to apply the provisions of this Protocol to bills of lading issued in a State which is a Party to the Convention but which is not a Party to this Protocol." Thus, the result of ratification or accession to the Visby Protocol by a nation is that the nation consents to be bound by the Hague-Visby Rules.

The general principle regarding the application of the Hague Rules is that they apply by their own force (_ex proprio vigore_) to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title.

The Hague-Visby Rules apply to the carriage of goods between ports in two different States if:

- a bill of lading is issued in a contracting state; or
- the carriage is from a port in a contracting state; or
- the Rules are incorporated by reference into the contract of carriage, regardless of the nationality of the ship, the carrier, the shipper, the consignee, or any other interested party.

Moreover, the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules apply not only to public or common carriage but may also apply to private carriage if an incorporating clause is included in the contract.

According to the Hague-Visby Rules the term "carrier" includes the owner or the charterer who enters into a contract of carriage with a shipper. After receiving the goods into his charge, the carrier, or the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading.

The bill of lading must include the leading marks necessary for identifying the goods, as provided in writing by the shipper before loading begins. These marks must be stamped or clearly displayed on the goods (if uncovered) or on their cases or coverings, in a manner that should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage. In addition, it should also enclose either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity, or weight, as furnished in writing by the shipper; as well as the apparent order and condition of the goods. Such a bill of lading shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described and proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith.

The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity and weight, as furnished by him. Therefore, the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper. Accordingly, no carrier, master, or agent of the carrier is obligated to state or include in the bill of lading any marks, numbers, quantity, or weight of the goods received if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is inaccurate or if they have had no reasonable means of verifying it.

The person entitled to delivery of goods, under the contract of carriage, can submit in writing the notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into his custody. If the loss or damage is not apparent, he can give the notice of loss or damage within three days. Unless the notice of loss or damage is given, such removal of the goods shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading. The notice in writing need not be given if the goods have been the subject of joint survey or inspection, at the time of their receipt.

Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage that seeks to relieve the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to goods, or in connection with goods, arising from negligence, fault, or failure in their duties and obligations, or that seeks to reduce such liability beyond what is permitted by the Hague-Visby Rules, shall be null, void, and without effect.

The carrier is bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy; to properly man, equip and supply the ship; and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation. The carrier shall also, properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied. The burden of proving due diligence is on the carrier.

The Hague-Visby Rules specify exceptions to the carrier's responsibility for the loss or damage of goods and state that neither the carrier nor the ship shall be held responsible for loss or damage arising from or resulting from:

(a) act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship;

(b) fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier;

(c) perils, dangers and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters;

(d) act of God;

(e) act of war;

(f) act of public enemies;

(g) arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or people, or seizure under legal process;

(h) quarantine restrictions;

(i) act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative;

(j) strikes or lock-outs or stoppage or restraint of labour from whatever cause, whether partial or general;

(k) riots and civil commotions;

(l) saving or attempting to save life or property at sea;

(m) wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, quality or vice of the goods;

(n) insufficiency of packing;

(o) insufficiency or inadequacy of marks;

(p) latent defects not discoverable by due diligence;

(q) any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.

The shipper will not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any aforementioned causes without the act, fault or neglect of the shipper, his agents or his servants. Moreover, the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any other reasonable deviation.

Under the Hague-Visby Rules, carrier's liability is limited and neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the goods in an amount exceeding 666.67 units of account per package or unit or 2 units of account per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher. The carrier, master or agent of the carrier and the shipper may agree to other maximum amounts, different than those aforementioned provided that no maximum amount so fixed shall be less than the appropriate maximum aforementioned. Exception represents the case when the nature and value of the goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading. The unit of account mentioned above is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts of limitations of liability shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency on the date to be determined by the law of the Court seized of the case.

Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

Regarding to carriage of goods of an inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature Hague-Visby Rules distinguish two possibilities; where the carrier, master or agent of the carrier has not consented to its shipment and had no knowledge of their nature and character and the opposite case; where he has consented and has been aware of its dangerous nature. In the first case those goods may, at any time before discharge, be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment. In the other case, when such goods are shipped with the knowledge and consent of the carrier, and they become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may, in like manner, be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.

The defences and limits of liability provided for in these Rules shall apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to goods covered by a contract of carriage whether the action be founded in contract or in tort. Moreover, if such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier, who is not an independent contractor, such servant or agent will be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under these Rules. This provision is known as Himalaya clause. It should be emphasized that the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, and such servants and agents, shall in no case exceed the limit provided for in these Rules. Nevertheless, a servant or agent of the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of these Rules, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

According to Hague-Visby Rules, a carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and liabilities under the Rules, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the bill of lading issued to the shipper. The provisions of these Rules shall not be applicable to charter parties, but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under a charter-party, they shall comply with the terms of these Rules. It is also prescribed that any lawful provision regarding general average may be inserted in a bill of lading.

Hague-Visby Rules give an opportunity to the carrier, master or agent of the carrier and a shipper to enter into special agreement in regard to any particular goods. That special agreement may stipulate any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness, so far as this stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the care or diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of the goods carried by water. The only precondition is that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a non-negotiable document and shall be marked as such. Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect.

The _ratio_ of adoption of Hague-Visby Rules was protection of interests of the shipper/cargo-owner. In order to achieve that, some minimum [affreightment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affreightment "Affreightment") obligations upon the carrier should have been imposed. Although some improvements were implemented, the carrier kept his greater legal position. Moreover, the Rules prescribe the right of a carrier or a shipper to enter into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation or exemption regarding the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to, or in connection with the custody and care and handling of goods, developed prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by water.

## Casualty Investigation Code

During the carriage of goods by sea, marine casualty or incident of navigation may occur causing loss of human life or serious injury or serious damage to ships or installations of another State or to the marine environment. Several international conventions, such as SOLAS, MARPOL, Load Lines Convention and UNCLOS, oblige Administrations to investigate any casualty sustained by ships under its flag and to supply the International Maritime Organization with pertinent information concerning the findings of such investigations. Accordingly, IMO adopted a new Code of International Standards and Recommended Practices for a Safety Investigation into a Marine Casualty or Marine Incident (Casualty Investigation Code) in 2008.

Relevant amendments to SOLAS Chapter XI-1 were also adopted, to make parts I and II of the Code mandatory. Part III of the Code contains related guidance and explanatory material. The new regulations, entered into force on 1 January 2010 and expand on SOLAS regulation I/21, which only required Administrations to undertake to investigate of any casualty occurring to any of its ships "when it judges that such an investigation may assist in determining what changes in the present regulations might be desirable". The Code now requires a marine safety investigation to be conducted into every "very serious marine casualty", defined as a marine casualty involving the total loss of the ship or a death or severe damage to the environment. The Code also recommends an investigation into other marine casualties and incidents, by the flag State of a ship involved, if it is considered likely that it would provide information that could be used to prevent future accidents.

The IMO has encouraged cooperation and recognition of mutual interest through a number of resolutions that were expanded by the Organization with the adoption of the Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents. Resolution A.884(21) on Amendments to the Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents resolution A.849(20), adopted in November 1999, provided guidelines for the investigation of human factors. The Assembly, at its twenty-eighth session adopted resolution A. 1075(28) on Guidelines to assist investigators in the implementation of the Casualty Investigation Code (resolution MSC.255(84)), revoking resolutions A.849(20) and A.884(21).

The safety of seafarers and passengers and the protection of the marine environment can be enhanced by timely and accurate reports identifying the circumstances and causes of marine casualties and incidents. Great contribution to this matter was also given by The Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) which includes a Maritime Casualties and Incidents module database, which includes data on Maritime Casualties and Incidents (MCI). This GISIS module also includes all casualty analyses, a Contact Point module where it is possible to search flag State contact points for PSC matters, Casualty investigation services and Ships' inspection services (including Secretariats of Memoranda of Understanding on Port State Control).

The IMO Secretariat worked with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) for harmonizing reporting procedures with the European Marine Casualty Information Platform (EMCIP) and avoiding duplication of reporting. The MCI module contains information collected through MSC-MEPC.3/Circ.4/Rev.1, as well as full investigation reports uploaded into the system. Part of this information is accessible to IMO Members only. Lessons learned are circulated to seafarers in order to increase awareness of seafarers to accidents for prevention purposes.

Having in mind that investigation and proper analysis of marine casualties and incidents can lead to greater awareness of casualty causation and result in remedial measures, including better training, for the purpose of enhancing safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment. In 2008, Casualty Investigation Code was adopted with the goal to provide, as far as national laws allow, a standard approach to marine casualty and incident investigation with the objective of preventing marine casualties and incidents in the future.

This Code incorporates and builds on the best practices in marine casualty and marine incident investigation that were established by the Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents, adopted in November 1997 by the IMO by resolution A.849(20). The Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents sought to promote co-operation and a common approach to marine casualty and marine incident investigations between States.

One of the most important prerequisites of the marine safety investigation is that it should be separate from, and independent of, any other form of investigation. This Code recognizes that under the Organization's instruments, each flag State has a duty to investigate any casualty occurring to any of its ships, when it judges that such an investigation may assist in determining what changes in the present regulations may be desirable, or if such a casualty has produced a major deleterious effect upon the environment.

According to the Code, marine casualty means an event, or a sequence of events, that has resulted in any of the following which has occurred directly in connection with the operations of a ship:

1. the death of, or serious injury to, a person;
2. the loss of a person from a ship;
3. the loss, presumed loss or abandonment of a ship;
4. material damage to a ship;
5. the stranding or disabling of a ship, or the involvement of a ship in a collision;
6. material damage to marine infrastructure external to a ship, that could seriously endanger the safety of the ship, another ship or an individual; or
7. severe damage to the environment, or the potential for severe damage to the environment, brought about by the damage of a ship or ships.

However, a marine casualty does not include a deliberate act or omission, with the intention to cause harm to the safety of a ship, an individual or the environment.

Opposite to marine casualty, a marine incident means an event, or sequence of events, other than a marine casualty, which has occurred directly in connection with the operations of a ship that endangered, or, if not corrected, would endanger the safety of the ship, its occupants or any other person or the environment. Similarly, to marine casualty, a marine incident does not include a deliberate act or omission, with the intention to cause harm to the safety of a ship, an individual or the environment.

The Code obliges the flag State of a ship, or ships involved to notify, as soon as is reasonably practicable, other substantially interested States, when a marine casualty occurs on the high seas or in an exclusive economic zone. When a marine casualty occurs within the territory, including the territorial sea of a coastal State, the flag State, and the coastal State, shall notify each other and between them notify other substantially interested States as soon as is reasonably practicable. Notification shall not be delayed due to the lack of complete information.

A marine safety investigation shall be conducted into every very serious marine casualty. A very serious marine casualty means a marine casualty involving the total loss of the ship or a death or severe damage to the environment. The flag State of a ship involved in a very serious marine casualty is responsible for ensuring that a marine safety investigation is conducted and completed in accordance with this Code. Without limiting the rights of States to conduct their own separate marine safety investigation, where a marine casualty occurs within the territory, including territorial sea, of a State, the flag State(s) involved in the marine casualty and the coastal State shall consult to seek agreement on which State or States will be the marine safety investigating State(s) in accordance with a requirement, or a recommendation acted upon, to investigate under this Code. The same provision valids if a marine casualty occurs on the high seas or in the exclusive economic zone of a State, and involves more than one flag State.

The Code instructs all States to ensure that their national laws provide investigator(s) carrying out a marine safety investigation with the ability to board a ship, interview the master and crew and any other person involved, and acquire evidential material for the purposes of a marine safety investigation. Moreover, where the marine safety investigating State(s) is conducting a marine safety investigation under this Code, it allows another substantially interested State to conduct its own separate marine safety investigation, parallelly. It is of crucial importance that investigator(s) carrying out a marine safety investigation are impartial and objective and that investigation report on results is brought without direction or interference from any persons or organizations who may be affected by its outcome.

The Code refers to seafarers' rights in the separate chapter and prescribes that all seafarers from whom evidence is sought shall be informed of the nature and basis of the marine safety investigation and shall be allowed access to legal advice. The seafarer's human rights shall, at all times, be upheld.

Where it is requested, the marine safety investigating State(s) will send a copy of a draft report to a substantially interested State to allow the substantially interested State to make comment on the draft report within 30 days or some other mutually agreed period. The marine safety investigating State(s) shall thoroughly review and carefully consider any comments received before finalizing the investigation report. If the acceptance or rejection of these comments directly impacts the interests of the submitting State, the investigating State(s) shall provide a formal notification to the substantially interested State, clearly explaining how the comments were addressed and the rationale behind the decision. If the marine safety investigating State(s) receives no comments after the 30 days or the mutually agreed period has expired, then it may proceed to finalize the report. Accordingly, the marine safety investigating State(s) will submit the final version of a marine safety investigation report to the IMO for every marine safety investigation conducted into a very serious marine casualty. The marine safety investigating State(s) will undertake all necessary steps to make the final report available to public and transparent, even where it is published by another State or the Organization.

States shall ensure that marine safety investigating authorities are provided with adequate material and financial resources, as well as a workforce of suitably qualified personnel. This support is essential to enable these authorities to effectively fulfil the State's obligations under this Code, including the conduct of thorough and timely marine safety investigations into marine casualties and incidents.

Furthermore, all investigations should be conducted in conformity with principles of investigations; independence, safety focused, cooperation, priority and scope of marine investigation.

If in the course of a marine safety investigation it becomes known or is suspected that an offence is committed under articles 3, 3bis, 3ter or 3quarter of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988 (SUA Convention), the marine safety investigation Authority should immediately seek to ensure that the maritime security Authorities of the State(s) concerned are informed.

During the marine safety investigation, the marine safety investigating State(s) should allow a substantially interested State to participate in aspects of the marine safety investigation relevant to it, to the extent practicable. Their participation should include allowing representatives of the substantially interested State to interview witnesses; view and examine evidence and make copies of documents; make submissions in respect of the evidence, comment on and have their views properly reflected in the final report; and be provided with the draft and final reports relating to the marine safety investigation.

The investigation itself should not unnecessarily detain a ship for the collection of evidence from it or have original documents or equipment removed unless this is essential for the purposes of the marine safety investigation. Likewise, States should ensure that investigator(s) carrying out a marine safety investigation should honour the principle of confidentiality of information.

The Code also provides necessary protection witnesses and involved parties and prescribes that if a person is required by law to provide evidence that may incriminate them, for the purposes of a marine safety investigation, the evidence should, so far as national laws allow, be prevented from admission into evidence in civil or criminal proceedings against the individual.

Finally, when new evidence is presented which may materially alter the analysis and conclusions reached, marine safety investigating State(s) which have completed a marine safety investigation, should reconsider their findings and consider re-opening the investigation.

## Charter parties

Through a shipping contract, the charterer acquires the right to use the ship, while the shipowner retains management of the ship and remains the carrier. By the **shipping contract**, the shipowner commits to the charterer to transport goods and make available for that transport a specified entire ship, a proportional part of the ship, or a designated ship's space. The transport must be carried out with the agreed-upon ship. In the contract, the ship is identified by its name, and the parties may also specify its characteristics. The elements used to individualize the ship in shipping contracts include: the ship's name, port of registry, nationality, gross and net tonnage, ship's carrying capacity, year of construction, ship class, ship's speed, and fuel consumption.

In shipping contracts, the principle applies that the agreed-upon ship cannot be substituted with another ship unless the parties anticipate such a possibility by including a substitution clause in the contract. Typically, this possibility is conditioned on the replacement ship being of the same or similar dimensions, capacity, technical characteristics, or class. The carrier may, with the consent of the charterer, replace the agreed-upon ship with another.

Practical reasons and the strong development of maritime traffic have led to the creation of standard forms (types) of shipping contracts, depending on specific navigation areas and types of cargo. The standard terms contained in these standard forms are well known to every user of transport service. This eliminates the need for lengthy negotiations or for agreeing on special conditions. The parties simply refer to a specific type of contract, which is recognized by its designation and commonly used abbreviations. If the parties wish to modify certain clauses of the standard contract, new conditions are added to the printed form, or those excluded by the contracting parties are deleted.

**A cancellation clause **grants the charterer the right to terminate the contract if the ship is not made available in the agreed port, in the agreed or usual condition, and before the expiration of the time specified in the clause. The cancellation clause does not necessarily lead to the termination of the contract. It is up to the charterer to decide whether to exercise the right granted by the clause. Based on the duration of the contract, shipping contracts are divided into time and voyage charter parties.

**A time charter party **is a maritime transport contract in which the shipowner agrees to carry out transports for the charterer using the agreed ship within the agreed time period, and the charterer agrees to pay the agreed freight for that period.

During the duration of the contract, the charterer is authorized to independently manage the ship in a commercial sense. The ship's master is obligated to follow the charterer's orders within the boundaries of the contract and according to the ship's intended use. The charterer's orders may relate to ports of call or the cargo to be transported. The charterer may order the transportation of any legally permissible cargo unless the ship's intended use or the contract specifies otherwise.

When a time charter is concluded for the entire ship, the charterer cannot designate a voyage that would expose the ship or its crew to dangers that could not have been foreseen at the time the contract was signed (e.g., war) or a voyage that cannot be reasonably expected to be completed without significantly exceeding the contract's agreed duration.

In time charter parties, the charterer bears the operating costs. In addition to paying freight, the charterer is responsible for supplying the ship, at their own expense, with fuel, lubricants, and water needed for the ship's propulsion engines and other machinery, as well as paying port charges and navigation fees. The shipowner designates the ship's master and crew and covers their wages and maintenance costs.

If the agreed speed or fuel consumption cannot be maintained due to bad weather or other causes, the master must provide an explanation and record it in the ship's logbook. Costs for the crew's overtime related to cargo operations are typically borne by the charterer. Special working time tables are kept for such cases.

The shipowner is entitled to freight only for the time during which the contract was performed. The shipowner is not entitled to freight during periods of disruption in the use of the ship if the disruption is not caused by the charterer. However, the shipowner is entitled to freight if the disruption is caused by the charterer or results from the execution of the charterer's orders. In a time charter party, the risk of delay is borne by the charterer, not the shipowner. This is a fundamental difference between a time charter and a voyage charter.

Under a **voyage charter party** the shipowner agrees to transport goods in one or more predetermined voyages. The document evidencing the contract is called a Voyage charter party. In the charter party, the voyage is defined by specifying the loading and unloading ports, or the charterer is authorized to designate a port from a predetermined list or within a specified geographical area.

The shipowner may commit to performing multiple predetermined voyages (consecutive voyages) under one contract. In such cases, multiple voyages are carried out under a single agreement. The contract may stipulate a specific number of voyages or define the number of voyages to be performed within a specified time frame. The contract ends when the agreed voyage is completed or, in the case of consecutive voyages, when the final agreed voyage is completed.

Freight is usually determined based on the quantity of cargo transported. The duration of the voyage does not affect the freight. Any delays during the execution of the voyage are at the expense of the shipowner, unlike in a time charter, where such costs are borne by the charterer. In the case of consecutive voyages, freight is charged based on the number of voyages actually performed.

In situations with a need for several voyages, there is an option for using the same vessel with one voyage directly after another, consecutive voyages or time chartering, and equally, but with different vessels upon the request of the charterers within the framework of an overriding contract, that is in the form of a **contract of affreightment**.

A contract of affreightment is an agreement between an owner and a charterer for the carriage of a certain amount and type of goods between agreed ports over a given period of time. It is not limited to a particular ship, but operates as a series of voyage charter parties. The GENCOA is BIMCO's standard contract of affreightment for dry bulk cargoes.

Contract of affreightment is considered to be legally very close to a voyage charter due to the fact that the main purpose of the contract is to oblige a vessel to lift a fixed determinable quantity of cargo of a specified type over a given period of time. Consequently, this form of contract usually operates as a series of voyage charters, but can also be used for line-traffic. Therefore, the freight accordingly is based on the quantity of cargo transported. Further, the contract of affreightment is characteristically recognized as a contract covering specified, homogeneous cargo, large quantities of cargo, long periods of transport, certain ports and several voyages. Contracts of affreightment diverge from other charter forms as they contain, separately, both time and voyage elements. It has the cargo, not the vessel, in the central position. The number of voyages is also decisive for the definition of the contract of affreightment. Although contract of affreightment can be used for only one voyage, such a contract is hardly recognized as a COA. In summary, a COA is usually a contract for the carriage of a specified type and quantity of cargo, covering two or several shipments, and running over a long period.

It is commonly held that such a contract, in which the means of transportation is generically determined, has no satisfactory and universally accepted name. The basis for this can be in the fact that the contract of affreightment is closer to the cargo and the obligation to transport than other contracts of carriage that are also connected to a certain vessel. The use of the terms like Cargo Contract of Affreightment, Tonnage Contracts, Cargo Contracts, Quantity Contracts, Volume Contract (of affreightment), and Transport Contract would perhaps better describe such contracts. These terms are used, but the term now generally-accepted is Contract of Affreightment.

**A bareboat charter party **is a contract whereby the lessor grants the lessee the use of a ship, in exchange for rent, for the purpose of performing maritime activities. The use of the ship includes the right to commercially exploit the ship and derive benefits from its operation. The lessee operates the ship at their own expense, as if they were the shipowner.

There is no uniform format for a bareboat charter. However, in business practice, standardized contract forms are regularly used for concluding bareboat charters. The standardized form for bareboat charters is BARECON (Standard Bareboat Charter), issued by the international organization BIMCO. In a bareboat charter party, the ship is delivered without a crew, unless otherwise agreed.

In a bareboat charter, the lessee _supplies the ship with a crew and appoints the ship's master_. The lessee has the right to change the crew. The crew is obligated to follow the lessee's orders, unless the contract specifies otherwise.

**Laydays** are the regular time allotted for loading or unloading cargo, for which no additional fee is paid. During laydays, the carrier is required to make the ship available to the shipper for loading or unloading the cargo. Laydays are determined by the contract, and if not specified, the duration of the laydays is determined according to the customs of the port where the loading or unloading takes place.

The time allocated for loading or unloading cargo is at the charterer's disposal, and they are entitled to use it in the way that suits them best. The carrier is not authorized to rush them, but the charterer is obligated to complete the loading or unloading before the laydays expire.

For the laydays to start running, the ship's master must notify the shipper in writing that the ship is ready for loading or unloading. This notification is given through a Notice of Readiness. A **Notice of Readiness** means informing the charterer, shipper, consignee, or another person, as stipulated in the contract, that the ship has arrived at the agreed port or berth and is ready for loading or unloading. A fundamental condition for the validity of the Notice of Readiness is that the ship has arrived at the contracted port. The Notice of Readiness is delivered to the shipper at their address during business hours.

The ship's master can deliver the Notice of Readiness if the ship is ready for loading and is at the loading place in the port or at anchor (if such is agreed or prescribed by local customs), if prior approval for free navigation and loading has been obtained, and if other actions necessary for cargo loading have been completed. The Notice of Readiness can also be delivered if the ship has not been brought to the loading place in the port or at anchor due to reasons for which the charterer is responsible. At the time the Notice of Readiness is delivered, the ship must, in every respect, be actually ready for the planned loading or unloading of cargo.

The delivery of the Notice of Readiness triggers the start of the laydays. In addition to the ship's master, the Notice of Readiness can also be delivered by the shipowner, the charterer (if acting as the carrier), or their maritime agent. The delivery of the Notice of Readiness is carried out directly, by letter, email, etc.

In order for the laydays to start running, or for the charterer to begin loading or unloading the cargo, it is necessary for the ship to arrive at the destination specified in the contract, be ready and in an appropriate condition for loading or unloading, and for the Notice of Readiness to be delivered to the charterer. Once these conditions are met, the ship is considered to have legally arrived, and the laydays can begin.

Laydays are calculated in working days and parts of working days, with one working day considered as 24 continuous hours. Sundays, public holidays, and other holidays when the port is closed are not included in the calculation of laydays, nor is the time when loading or unloading was not possible due to weather conditions or issues on the ship's side. When unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the contracting parties prevent loading or unloading, this is considered a stoppage of the laydays (e.g., force majeure, government-imposed restrictions, strikes, war, etc.).

The duration of laydays is usually determined separately for the loading port and the unloading port. However, the parties may agree that laydays will be calculated as a single period for both loading and unloading. These are called **reversible laydays**. In this case, time saved during loading can be used for unloading.

After loading or unloading is completed, a written report of the operation's progress is compiled for the final calculation of laydays. This document is called a time sheet. It describes the progress of the loading or unloading operation by days, hours, and minutes, including any justified stoppages and the final calculation of the laydays duration. The time sheet serves as evidence. If the parties disagree on any details, the final decision is made by arbitration or a court.

Once the agreed laydays have passed, and the loading or unloading is not completed, the time for **demurrage** begins to run. During the demurrage period, the carrier is entitled to an additional charge. The right to compensation for demurrage may be provided by law, contract, or port custom. The duration of the demurrage is calculated in continuous days and parts of days, without interruption. The charge for demurrage is typically calculated on a 24-hour basis, and Sundays, public holidays, or other reasons for which the laydays were interrupted are not considered. The time lost due to issues on the ship's side is not included in the demurrage period. The demurrage also includes the time lost while the ship is waiting for the shipper to provide customs and other documents necessary for loading, transportation, or unloading of the cargo.

The demurrage charge is paid in advance for the entire day, but if the loading is completed before the end of the day for which the charge was paid, the carrier is required to refund the proportional part of the charge. If the demurrage charge is not paid by the due date, the ship may immediately depart with the loaded cargo. This can happen even after the demurrage period has expired.

The time for which the loading or unloading process was completed before the end of the agreed or customary laydays is called saved time. Since the ship is made available to the shipper for the duration of the laydays, there is no legal basis for the shipper to claim compensation for saved time from the carrier. However, the parties may specify this right in the contract. Since saved time benefits the carrier, as it can then use the ship for other tasks, it is common in shipping contracts for the carrier to be obliged to pay the shipper **compensation for saved time.**

The amount of compensation for saved time is usually half of the demurrage charge. The compensation for saved time is usually calculated separately for loading and separately for unloading.

The bill of lading is prepared by the carrier based on written data provided by the shipper. This does not apply to the data concerning the carrier, the ship, the condition of the cargo at the time of receipt for transport, the place and date of loading, and the issuance of the bill of lading, which the carrier enters independently in the bill of lading. The bill of lading is signed by the carrier or their authorized representative. The master of the ship and the maritime agent are authorized to sign the bill of lading in their position. This may also be done by any other person based on the carrier's special power of attorney.

**The bill of lading** is a document that proves the maritime transport contract and the receipt or loading of goods by the carrier, obliging the carrier to deliver the goods upon surrendering the document.

Although the bill of lading is proof of the existence and content of the transport contract, it is not a written contract for the maritime transport of goods. The content of the contract consists of the contractual clauses printed on the bill of lading form or entered into the bill of lading at the time of its issuance.

The bill of lading is a _negotiable document_, and the enforcement of rights from the bill of lading is conditional upon the holder possessing and presenting the document itself. By presenting the bill of lading, the holder gains the right to directly demand the delivery of the goods specified in the bill from the carrier.

According to _the Hague-Visby Rules_, the bill of lading creates a rebuttable presumption that the carrier has received the goods in the quantity and condition stated in the document. Counter-evidence is not allowed when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith. This means that in the relationship between the carrier and a third lawful holder of the bill of lading in good faith, the details about the cargo contained in the bill are considered irrefutable evidence.

**Freight **is the fee that the user of the transport must pay the carrier for the completed transport or for the use of the vessel to carry out the transport (in the case of time charter agreements). The term "freight" includes all expenses the carrier incurs to carry out the agreed transport, which the carrier is entitled to claim from the transport user according to the contract. Freight includes propulsion costs, crew expenses, loading, stowing, and unloading costs if the carrier bears them, laytime, and other related costs.

If the freight rate for a voyage charter agreement is determined per unit of time, and during the voyage a disturbance occurs in the performance of the contract on the carrier's side without the fault of the charterer or shipper, no freight is due for the duration of the disturbance.

According to the Off-hire clause, the charterer does not pay freight for the period when the carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations, until the ship is again able to continue performing the contract. In time charters, along with the right to claim damages, the charterer is entitled to an extension of the contract for the period the vessel was out of service. Events that lead to the vessel being out of service are those that temporarily prevent the vessel from being used commercially in the agreed or usual manner.

In the case of loss or damage to goods, the evidence of the letter of protest from the ship's master or his statement regarding the retention of rights is especially important. A protest letter is a statement from the ship's master addressed to a third party, informing that party that it is considered responsible for the damage. The master of the ship must, in order to protect the interests of the shipowner and the P&I club, send a letter of protest to the third party deemed responsible for the damage. The letter of protest should describe the event and declare that the ship holds the third party responsible for the damage.

If there is a shortage, loss, or damage to goods, the master of the ship is required to notify the shipowner and the P&I club the ship is registered with. The cargo must be inspected, and the damage determined. In determining the damage, the master must cooperate with the shipowner and representatives of the P&I club and follow their orders and instructions.

## Hamburg Rules

_The United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea_ was adopted in 1978 in Hamburg at the United Nations Diplomatic Conference. The Convention is commonly known as _the_ _Hamburg Rules_. It came into force in 1992. The main motivation for adopting the new convention was to protect users of transportation, primarily those countries that are mainly importers and/or exporters of goods without a strong fleet. A key feature of these countries is that _the_ _Hamburg Rules_ significantly tighten the carrier's liability. _The Hamburg Rules_ offer interesting contemporary solutions, but they have not been widely accepted.

The primary objection from opponents of the Hamburg Rules is that they are the result of a political compromise, and their commercial impact was not sufficiently considered during the decision-making process. A benefit of the Hamburg Rules, however, is that they are written in modern language and style, making them well-suited to the existing international and transport law.

_The Hamburg Rules_ do not apply to shipping contracts themselves, but they do apply to bills of lading issued in connection with shipping contracts. Under _the Hamburg Rules_, the carrier's liability covers the period from the moment the goods are received for shipment in the loading port until the moment the goods are delivered to the consignee in the discharge port. This expands the carrier's responsibility for damage to goods and delays to the period before the goods are loaded onto the vessel and the period after the goods are discharged from the vessel. The legal basis for the carrier's liability for damage to goods is presumed fault. The Hamburg Rules do not recognize the concept of excepted cases, which most clearly reflects the attempt by the editors to tighten the carrier's liability compared to the _Hague-Visby Rules_

Unlike _the Hague-Visby Rules_, _the Hamburg Rules_ apply to the carriage of live animals by sea and to goods transported on deck.

Regarding live animals, the carrier is not liable for damage during transport if they can prove that the loss, damage, or delay resulted from specific and particular risks associated with the transport of live animals. In addition, the carrier must prove that they followed the consignor's instructions. This implies that the principle of the carrier's fault must be demonstrated in these cases. _The Hamburg Rules_ do not allow parties the freedom to contract differently in the case of live animal transport.

In relation to goods transported on deck, _the Hamburg Rules_ distinguish between authorized and unauthorized carriage. Authorized carriage occurs when there is an agreement between the carrier and the consignor or when it is customary or required. If a good is damaged while on deck, such authorized carriage may ease the carrier's position in an attempt to avoid liability, as they can cite specific risks that threatened the goods on deck and that could not be avoided even with reasonable precautions. Unauthorized carriage on deck means the carrier is liable for any damage to goods and any delays solely because the goods were carried on deck without authorization. The carrier's position will not be eased by proving they acted with due care, i.e., by taking all reasonable measures to avoid harmful consequences, unless they can prove that the damage would have occurred even if the goods had been placed below deck.
