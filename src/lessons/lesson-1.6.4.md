With the emergence of steam ships, collisions became more frequent and posed a more serious problem. In response, the _Comité Maritime International_ (CMI) prepared and drafted an international Convention addressing the law of collisions at sea. This draft was adopted as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law with respect to Collisions between Vessels at the International Maritime Conference held in Brussels in 1910 (commonly known as the 1910 Collision Convention). The principles codified in the 1910 Collision Convention have been particularly influential within Europe, as the leading European maritime nations -in terms of ships flying their national flags - have invariably ratified the Convention. However, on a global level, taking account of flags of convenience, the Convention's significance has diminished. This decline is largely due to the fact that major flag-of-convenience nations, such as Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands, have not ratified the convention. Together, these nations account for nearly 40 percent of the world's ships by gross registered tonnage. The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law with Respect to Collisions between Vessels, 1910, came into force in 1913.

The 1910 Collision Convention does not explicitly define the terms "vessel" or "collision," but it provides key elements for interpreting both. Under the Convention, a "vessel" is considered any seagoing or inland waterway vessel of any type, including hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft, and floating platforms - except when such platforms are stationary and engaged in the exploration, exploitation, or production of seabed mineral resources. In accordance with other maritime Conventions, the 1910 Collision Convention does not apply to warships or to other government vessels exclusively used for a public service. Finally, the 1910 Collision Convention establishes only non-contractual obligations arising from ship collisions and does not affect contractual obligations. As the 1910 Collision Convention does not provide a comprehensive set of detailed rules, it is up to the contracting parties to determine those details within their domestic tort laws.  Moreover, it is for the contracting parties to implement the principles of the convention into their respective legal system of non-contractual obligations.

Although the Collision Convention does not explicitly define "collision", it can be understood as any accident involving two or more vessels that results in loss or damage, even in the absence of actual physical contact. It applies to collisions between sea-going vessels and between sea- going vessels and vessels engaged in inland navigation. However, it does not apply to collisions solely between vessels of inland navigation. The scope of the Convention extends to the making good of damages which one vessel caused to another, or to goods or persons on board either vessel, as a result of executing or failing to execute a manoeuvre, or due to the non-observance of regulations. Importantly, the Convention does not require physical contact between vessels for it to apply. Such cases, where damage occurs without direct contact, are considered examples of indirect collisions.

A collision can occur either accidentally or due to fault. If the collision is accidental, caused by _force majeure_, or if the cause remains uncertain, the damages are borne by those who suffer them. This rule applies even if one or more vessels were anchored or otherwise secured at the time of the incident.

In contrast, if a collision is caused by the fault of one vessel, the vessel at fault is liable for the resulting damages. When two or more vessels are at fault, liability is apportioned according to the degree of fault attributed to each vessel. If it is impossible to determine the extent of each vessel's fault, or if the faults are deemed equal, liability is shared equally.

The Convention establishes that, as a general principle, there are no joint or solidary obligations. Instead, liability is proportional to the degree of fault. However, an exception to this principle applies to cases involving death or personal injury, where different rules may govern liability. Under the 1910 Collision Convention, liability for damages is only assigned if the collision was caused by a party's fault. If no party is at fault, or if the collision was due to _force majeure_, no liability arises. The same holds true if fault cannot be established with certainty. The Convention does not define a specific standard of fault, as it does not include explicit behavioural rules (e.g., intent, recklessness, or actions with privity or knowledge). However, Article 13 of the Convention refers to the "non-observance of the regulations", acknowledging the applicability of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). These navigational rules, which date back to the 19th century, were consolidated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea in 1972 and have gained worldwide acceptance. A breach of the COLREGs is considered a fault under the 1910 Collision Convention. Additionally, fault may also arise from a violation of applicable national navigation rules, provided these rules do not conflict with the COLREGs.

The damages caused, either to the vessels or to their cargoes or to the effects or other property of the crews, passengers, or other persons on board, are borne by the vessels in fault in the above proportions. Even for claims from third parties, a vessel is not liable for more than its proportional share of the damages. Notably, the fault and liability of the vessel extend to the shipowner. Actions to recover damages are time-barred after two years from the date of the collision.

The Convention establishes that a vessel's liability applies even when the collision is caused by the fault of a pilot, including pilots engaged by legal compulsion. Additionally, all legal presumptions of fault in relation to collision liability are abolished.

After a collision, the master of each vessel involved is obligated to render assistance to the other vessel, its crew, and its passengers, provided doing so does not endanger their own vessel, crew, or passengers.

The master must also, where possible, inform the other vessel of the name of their vessel, its home port, and its previous and intended ports of call. Failure to fulfil this obligation does not, however, impose liability on the shipowner.

The provisions of this Convention do not affect national laws on the limitation of shipowners' liability or affect legal obligations arising from contracts of carriage or other agreements. Since the Convention does not define the extent of recoverable damages or what constitutes damage, contracting states are free to apply their own national laws, provided these do not undermine the Convention's principles. In this context, the Comité Maritime International (CMI) adopted the Lisbon Rules of 1987, a non-binding recommendation providing detailed rules on compensation and apportionment of damages.

The 1910 Collision Convention is primarily concerned with establishing and unifying the basic principles of liabilities for damages caused by a collision at sea between the parties involved. Consequently, it does not establish a consistent set of detailed rules but leaves the details and implementation of these basic principles to the parties contracting parties. Furthermore, the Convention applies when all vessels involved belong to states that are High Contracting Parties or in cases governed by national laws.
