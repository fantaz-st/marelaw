## Masters’ obligations concerning danger messages:

_Regulation 31 of Chapter V: Danger messages_

The master of every ship which meets with dangerous ice, a dangerousderelict, or any other direct danger to navigation, or a tropical storm, orencounters sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force windscausing severe ice accretion on superstructures, or winds of force 10 or aboveon the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received, is bound tocommunicate the information by all means at his disposal to ships in thevicinity, and also to the competent authorities. The form in which theinformation is sent is not obligatory. It may be transmitted either in plainlanguage (preferably English) or by means of the International Code of Signals.

Each Contracting Government will take all steps necessary to ensurethat when intelligence of any of the dangers is received, it will be promptlybrought to the knowledge of those concerned and communicated to otherinterested Governments

The transmission of messages respecting the dangers specified is freeof cost to the ships concerned and all radio messages issued shall be precededby the safety signal, using the procedure as prescribed by the RadioRegulations as defined in regulation IV/2.

## Information required in danger messages:

_Regulation 32 of Chapter V: Information required in danger messages_

The following information is required in danger messages:

1. _Ice, derelicts and other direct dangers tonavigation_: (i) The kind of ice, derelict or danger observed; (ii) The positionof the ice, derelict or danger when last observed; (iii) The time and date(Universal Co-ordinated Time) when the danger was last observed.
2. _Tropical cyclones (storms_): (i) A statementthat a tropical cyclone has been encountered. This obligation should beinterpreted in a broad spirit, and information transmitted whenever the masterhas good reason to believe that a tropical cyclone is developing or exists inthe neighbourhood; (ii) Time, date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) and positionof ship when the observation was taken.
   The term tropical cyclone is the generic term used by national meteorological servicesof the World Meteorological Organization. The terms hurricane, typhoon,cyclone, severe tropical storm, etc, may also be used, depending on thegeographical location.
3. _As much of the following information as ispracticable should be included in the message:_ (i) barometricpressure, preferably corrected (stating millibars, millimetres, or inches, andwhether corrected or uncorrected); (ii) barometric tendency (the change inbarometric pressure during the past three hours); (iii) true wind direction;(iv) wind force (Beaufort scale); (v) state of the sea (smooth, moderate,rough, high); (vi) swell (slight, moderate, heavy) and the true direction fromwhich it comes. Period or length of swell (short, average, long) would also beof value; (vii) true course and speed of ship.

When a master has reported a tropical cyclone or other dangerousstorm, it is desirable but not obligatory, that further observations be madeand transmitted hourly, if practicable, but in any case, at intervals of notmore than 3 hours, so long as the ship remains under the influence of thestorm.

When dealing with storms other than the tropical cyclones orsub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force wind causing severeice accretion on superstructures, when such storms or conditions are encountered,the message should contain similar information but excluding details concerningsea and swell.

## Masters’ discretionand safe navigation:

_Regulation 34 ofChapter V: Safe navigation and avoidance of dangerous situations_

_Regulation 34-1 ofChapter V: Master’s discretion_

Prior to proceeding to sea, the mastershall ensure that the intended voyage has been planned to use the appropriatenautical charts and nautical publications for the area concerned, taking intoaccount the guidelines and recommendations developed by the Organization. Thevoyage plan shall identify a route which: (i) takes into account any relevantships' routeing systems; (ii) ensures sufficient sea room for the safe passageof the ship throughout the voyage; (iii) anticipates all known navigationalhazards and adverse weather conditions; and (iv) takes into account the marineenvironmental protection measures that apply, and avoids as far as possibleactions and activities which could cause damage to the environment.

On the other hand, the owner, thecharterer, the company operating the ship as defined in regulation IX/1, or anyother person shall not prevent or restrict the master of the ship from takingor executing any decision which, in the master’s professional judgement, isnecessary for safety of life at sea an protection of the marine environment.

## Distress situations:

_Regulation 35 of Chapter V: Misuse of distress signals_

Under Regulation 35 referred to Misuse ofdistress signals, SOLAS establishes that the use of an international distresssignal, except for the purpose of indicating that a person or persons are indistress, and the use of any signal which may be confused with an internationaldistress signal, are prohibited.

_Regulation 33 ofChapter V: Distress situations, obligations and procedures_ (Obligations of aMaster receiving a signal of distress)

The master of a ship at sea which is in aposition to be able to provide assistance on receiving information from anysource that persons are in distress at sea, is bound to proceed with all speedto their assistance, if possible informing them or the search and rescueservice that the ship is doing so. This obligation to provide assistanceapplies regardless of the nationality or status of such persons or thecircumstances in which they are found. If the ship receiving the distress alertis unable or, in the special circumstances of the case, considers itunreasonable or unnecessary to proceed to their assistance, the master mustenter in the log-book the reason for failing to proceed to the assistance ofthe persons in distress, taking into account the recommendation of theOrganization, to inform the appropriate search and rescue service accordingly.

Contracting Governments shall co-ordinateand co-operate to ensure that masters of ships providing assistance byembarking persons in distress at sea are released from their obligations withminimum further deviation from the ships' intended voyage, provided thatreleasing the master of the ship from the obligations under the currentregulation does not further endanger the safety of life at sea. The ContractingGovernment responsible for the search and rescue region in which suchassistance is rendered shall exercise primary responsibility for ensuring suchco-ordination and co-operation occurs, so that survivors assisted aredisembarked from the assisting ship and delivered to a place of safety, takinginto account the particular circumstances of the case and guidelines developedby the Organization. In these cases, the relevant Contracting Governments shallarrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonablypracticable

In any case, Masters of ships who haveembarked persons in distress at sea shall treat them with humanity, within thecapabilities and limitations of the ship (Reg. 33.6)

_Regulation 33 ofChapter V: Distress situations, obligations and procedures_ (Rights of a Masterin a ship in distress)

The master of a ship in distress or thesearch and rescue service concerned, after consultation, so far as may bepossible, with the masters of ships which answer the distress alert, has theright to requisition one or more of those ships as the master of the ship indistress or the search and rescue service considers best able to renderassistance, and it shall be the duty of the master or masters of the ship orships requisitioned to comply with the requisition by continuing to proceedwith all speed to the assistance of persons in distress.

_Regulation 33 ofChapter V: Distress situations, obligations, and procedures_ (release of theobligation to render service)

Masters of ships shall be released fromthe obligation imposed:

(i)       On learning that their ships have not beenrequisitioned and that one or more other ships have been requisitioned and arecomplying with the requisition;

(ii)     If his ship has been requisitioned, on beinginformed by the persons in distress or by the search and rescue service or bythe master of another ship which has reached such persons that assistance is nolonger necessary.

## Navigational equipment:

_Regulation 19 of Chapter v: Carriage requirements for shipbornenavigational systems and equipment_

All ships irrespective of size shall have:

- A properly adjusted standard magnetic compass, or other means, independent of any powersupply to determine the ship's heading and display the reading at the mainsteering position.
- A pelorus orcompass bearing device, or other means, independent of any power supply to takebearings over an arc of the horizon of 360 degrees.
- Means ofcorrecting heading and bearings to true at all times;
- Nautical chartsand nautical publications to plan and display the ship's route for the intendedvoyage and to plot and monitor positions throughout the voyage.
- Back-uparrangements to meet the functional requirements if this function is partly orfully fulfilled by electronic means
- A receiver for aglobal navigation satellite system or a terrestrial radionavigation system, orother means, suitable for use at all times throughout the intended voyage toestablish and update the ship's position by automatic means;
- If less than 150gross tonnage and if practicable, a radar reflector, or other means, to enabledetection by ships navigating by radar at both 9 and 3 GHz;
- When the ship'sbridge is totally enclosed and unless the Administration determines otherwise,a sound reception system, or other means, to enable the officer in charge ofthe navigational watch to hear sound signals and determine their direction;
- A telephone, orother means, to communicate heading information to the emergency steeringposition, if provided.

When "other means" are permitted under thisregulation, such means must be approved by Administration in accordance withregulation 18.

It needs to be taken into account that otherrequirements may be in force regarding the size of the ship.

## Approval of systems and equipment:

_Regulation 18 ofChapter V: Approval, surveys and performance standards of navigational systemsand equipment and voyage data recorder_

Systems and equipment required to meetthe requirements of regulations 19 and 20 shall be of a type approved by theAdministration. The Administration shall require that the manufacturers have aquality control system audited by a competent authority to ensure continuouscompliance with the type approval conditions. Alternatively, the Administrationmay use final product verification procedures where the compliance with thetype approval certificate is verified by a competent authority before theproduct is installed on board ships.

The voyage data recorder system,including, all sensors, shall be subjected to an annual performance test. Acopy of the certificate of compliance issued by the testing facility, statingthe date of compliance and the applicable performance standards, shall beretained on board the ship.

The automatic identification system (AIS)shall be subjected to an annual test. The test shall be conducted by anapproved surveyor or an approved testing or servicing facility. A copy of thetest report shall be retained on board the ship

## Manning:

_Regulation 14 of Chapter V: Ships’ manning_

Contracting Governments undertake, eachfor its national ships, to maintain, or, if it is necessary, to adopt, measuresfor the purpose of ensuring that, from the point of view of safety of life atsea, all ships shall be sufficiently and efficiently manned.

For every ship to which chapter Iapplies, the Administration shall establish appropriate minimum safe manningfollowing a transparent procedure, taking into account the relevant guidanceadopted by the Organization (Principles of minimum safe manning, adopted by theOrganization by resolution A.1047(27)); and issue an appropriate minimum safemanning document or equivalent as evidence of the minimum safe manningconsidered necessary to comply with the provisions of paragraph 1.

On all ships, to ensure effective crewperformance in safety matters, a working language shall be established andrecorded in the ship's log-book. The company, as defined in regulation IX/1, orthe master, as appropriate, shall determine the appropriate working language.Each seafarer shall be required to understand and, where appropriate, giveorders and instructions and to report back in that language. If the workinglanguage is not an official language of the State whose flag the ship isentitled to fly, all plans and lists required to be posted shall include atranslation into the working language.

On ships to which chapter I applies,English shall be used on the bridge as the working language forbridge-to-bridge and bridge-to-shore safety communications as well as forcommunications on board between the pilot and bridge watchkeeping personnel , unlessthose directly involved in the communication speak a common language other thanEnglish.

## PSC in relation to manning:

_Regulation 4 ofChapter XI-1: Port State Control on operational requirements_

A ship when in a port of anotherContracting Government is subject to control by officers duly authorized bysuch Government concerning operational requirements in respect of the safety ofships, when there are clear grounds for believing that the master or crew arenot familiar with essential shipboard procedures relating to the safety ofships.

The Contracting Government carrying outthe control shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not sailuntil situation has been brought to order in accordance with the requirementsof the present Convention.

## Minimum safe manning document:

Assembly Resolution A.1047(27), adoptedon 30th November 2011, that established the Principles of MinimumSafe Manning, includes in Annex 4 the Guidance on Contents and Model Form ofMinimum Safe Manning Document.

The following information should beincluded in the minimum safe manning document issued by the Administrationspecifying the minimum safe manning:
