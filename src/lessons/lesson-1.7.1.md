## Introduction to Ballast Water and main purpose of the BWM Convention

**Ballast water** is water carried in the ballast tanks of ships to improve stability, balance and structural integrity. When ships unload their cargo, they take on ballast water to ensure a safe operating condition. When they load cargo, they discharge ballast water. The problem and direct threat to marine ecosystems and biodiversity is that ballast water can contain various aquatic organisms: Algae, cysts, larvae of mussels, fish, snails and crabs, as well as bacteria and viruses that can be invasive when discharged into the new environment.

As a result, in 2004. the IMO has adopted the **International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments**. BWM Convention entered into force globally on 8 September **2017**.

Main **Objective**: To help prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms through ships' ballast water. From 2017 ships must manage their ballast water in such a way that aquatic organisms and pathogens are removed or rendered harmless before the ballast water is discharged at a new location.

**Global Reach**: The convention applies to ships registered under contracting Parties to the BWM Convention, which take up and use ballast water during international voyages

The BWMC is essential for protecting marine ecosystems, supporting sustainable shipping, and minimizing economic losses from invasive species.

## Key Requirements of the BWMC

Ships have to carry:

**Ballast Water Management Plan (BWMP**): the ship-specific ballast water management plan contains a detailed description of the measures to be taken to implement the ballast water management requirements and additional ballast water management practices. More about BWMP available at: [\_https://library.arcticportal.org](https://library.arcticportal.org/1913/1/International%20Convention%20for%20the%20Control%20and%20Management%20of%20Ships%27%20Ballast%20Water%20and%20Sediments.pdf)_, **and **https://youtu.be/aPsGcCixTc0?t=48_

**Ballast Water Record Book**: Every ship must keep records of all ballast water operations, including when and where water is taken on, treated or discharged. It should also record when ballast water is discharged into a reception facility and when accidental or other exceptional discharges of ballast water occur.

**Ballast Water Treatment Systems** (BWTS): Ships must install IMO-approved systems to treat ballast water before discharge. Regulation D-3 of the Convention covers approval requirements for ballast water management systems. Treatment methods include: Filtration, UV treatment, Chemical disinfection.

**International Ballast Water Management Certificate** (ships of 400 GT and above). Ships must be issued an International Ballast Water Management Certificate (IBWMC) **after inspection by their flag state. IBWMC** certifies that the ship carries out ballast water management in accordance with the BWM Convention and specifies which standard the ship is complying with.

## Ballast Water Performance Standards

There are two ballast water management standards (D-1 and D-2).

**D-1 Standard: **Ballast water exchange. Ships should exchange at least 95% of ballast water in the open sea, at least 200 nautical miles from the nearest land and in waters at least 200 meters deep. This way, fewer organisms can survive, which means that ships are less likely to introduce harmful species when they discharge ballast water.

**D-2 Standard: **Ballast water treatment. The number of viable organisms in discharged water must meet specified limits.From the date of entry into force of the BWM Convention, all ships must conform to at least the D-1 standard; and all new ships, to the D-2 standard. As of September 2024, all ships must comply with the D-2 standard.

**_Seafarers play a crucial role in ensuring compliance by operating ballast water systems, maintaining accurate records, and following proper ballast water exchange procedures._**
