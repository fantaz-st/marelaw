**The international law of the sea** is a part of public international law. It comprises a system of rules of international law governing the limits of state jurisdiction at sea, the rights and duties of subjects of international law in certain areas of the sea, seabed and subsoil, and their mutual relations arising out of the various uses of the sea and the exploitation of the sea and seabed. It regulates the rational management, exploration, protection, conservation and improvement of natural marine resources, the seabed and the marine environment. It also covers relations in naval warfare between states involved in armed conflict and between these states and neutral states.

The international law of the sea has developed over centuries as **customary law**. It was not until the 20th century that international treaties began to address the complex relationships between states with respect to the law of the sea (as states have different priorities with respect to the various uses of the sea). These efforts were aimed at codifying the law of the sea. The Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea began in 1973 and ended with the signing of _the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea_ (UNCLOS) on 10th December 1982 in Montego Bay (Jamaica). It entered into force on 16th November 1994, one year after it had been ratified by 60 countries.

_The Convention_ consists of 320 articles and 9 annexes (I Highly migratory species; II Commission on the limits of the continental shelf; III Basic conditions of prospecting, exploration and exploitation; IV Statute of the enterprises; V Conciliation; VI Statute of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea; VII Arbitration; VIII Special arbitration and IX Participation by international organizations). _The Convention_ included numerous rules of the international law of the sea valid at that time, but in its important parts it also contains numerous novelties that became mandatory for the states parties to _the Convention_ after _the Convention_ entered into force. _The Convention_ regulates all aspects of the ocean space, such as delimitation, environmental control, scientific exploration of the sea, economic and commercial activities, technology transfer and settlement of disputes related to ocean issues.

**Internal waters** are the parts of the sea between the coast and the starting line from which the width of the territorial sea is measured. They are closely connected with the land area and under the unlimited authority of the coastal state, as is the land area of ​​the state. They include sea areas of harbours, bays, river estuaries, closed seas, and under certain conditions also parts of the sea between the island chain and the continental part of the mainland and between the islands themselves. **A bay** is considered a well-defined inlet into the land, where the sea area is equal to or greater than the area of a semicircle which diameter is equal to the length of the straight line closing the entrance to the bay. The sea area of the bay is measured from the low-water line along the coast of the bay to the straight line closing the entrance. The sovereignty of the coastal state extends to the airspace above the internal waters, as well as to the seabed and subsoil of these areas. Given that internal waters fall under the sovereignty of the coastal state, national regulations of the coastal state primarily apply to this part of the sea, with international law having a significantly minor extent.

The responsibility for enforcing regulations related to international navigation primarily rests with the **flag state**. However, as ships enter zones closer to the coast, the influence of the **coastal state's jurisdiction**, and especially that of the **port state**, becomes increasingly stronger.

The **territorial sea** follows the internal waters, and they together form the **sovereign territory** of the coastal state. _The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea_ (UNCLOS) definitively established the maximum width of the **territorial sea,** up to a limit of 12 nautical miles measured from the baseline, which also serves as the outer boundary of the internal waters. To determine baselines, international maritime law uses two methods: _the normal baseline method and the straight baseline method,_ which is used by states with indented coastlines. The outer boundary of the territorial sea is the state border at sea. Each island has its own territorial sea, unless the island is included within the area of internal waters. In the territorial sea, the seabed, and the airspace above it, the coastal state has sovereignty, but unlike in internal waters, this sovereignty is limited by international law, primarily concerning the right of innocent passage for foreign ships.

**Innocent passage** of a vessel refers to navigating through the territorial sea with the purpose of traversing this area without entering the internal waters (a port open to international traffic), or navigating with the purpose of entering internal waters (a port or a shipyard for repairs), or exiting the territorial sea. The key condition is that this passage must not disturb the peace, order, or security of the coastal state. The coastal state may set special conditions for certain types of vessels (e.g., a minimum speed for the innocent passage of foreign fishing vessels through territorial waters, or it may limit the number of foreign warships passing through the territorial sea simultaneously). Foreign submarines and other underwater vessels must navigate on the surface and display their flag while in the territorial sea.

Innocent passage must be conducted by a foreign vessel along the shortest customary route, without any interruptions or delays. However, passage may include stopping and anchoring, but only when necessary due to force majeure (uncontrollable circumstances) or to provide assistance to individuals or vessels in distress.

A foreign ship's passage will not be considered innocent if the ship engages in any of the following activities:

- threatens or uses force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of the coastal state, or acts in any other manner contrary to the principles of international law outlined in the UN Charter,
- conducts exercises or training with any kind of weapons,
- collects information or data that may be harmful to the defense or security of the coastal state,
- engages in propaganda that harms the defense or security of the coastal state,
- takes off, lands, or receives any aircraft onboard,
- launches, lands, or receives any military device onboard,
- loads or unloads goods, currency, or persons in violation of the customs, tax, immigration, or health regulations of the coastal state,
- intentionally or significantly pollutes the marine environment,
- engages in fishing or the harvesting of other marine creatures,
- researches, explores or surveys,
- engages in activities intended to unlawfully interfere with any communication system or other system of the coastal state, and
- carries out any other activity that is not directly related to passage.

**The contiguous zone**, with the same authority as established in the 1958 Geneva _Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone_, is extended in width and can reach up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the width of the territorial sea is measured. It is part of the high seas where the coastal state holds specific and limited authority over administrative functions. In the contiguous zone, the coastal state's competent authorities may exercise control to prevent violations of customs, fiscal, and sanitary regulations that could be committed within its land territory, internal waters, and territorial sea, as well as to punish violations of these regulations that occur in those areas.

_The Convention_ regulates **the regime of international straits** used for international navigation. With the extension of territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, coastal states were enabled to cover a large number of straits within their territorial waters. Therefore, _the_ _Convention_ introduced a special _right of transit passage_ through such straits, which is somewhat more liberal than the right of innocent passage through territorial waters. Transit passage encompasses all types of ships and aircraft (including the right of overflight), including submarines, which are not required to navigate on the surface. The coastal state's right to enact regulations applies to a narrower set of issues than in innocent passage, and neither civil nor criminal jurisdiction is foreseen, nor the right to take measures necessary to prevent passage that threatens the coastal state. The list of prohibited activities in transit passage is also shorter than in innocent passage.

**The waters of archipelagic states** (archipelagic waters) is a new term in _the Convention_. It includes parts of the sea within the archipelagic baselines that may be drawn to connect the outermost points of the most distant islands and surface reefs of the archipelago, provided that the main islands and the area where the ratio of sea to land is between 1:1 and 9:1 are enclosed by these lines. The baselines of the archipelagos may not exceed a length of 100 nautical miles. However, up to 3% of the total number of these lines connecting the individual archipelagos may exceed this length, but not more than 125 nautical miles. The archipelagic state exercises sovereignty over the archipelagic waters, their seabed, the resources in the maritime zone and the airspace over the archipelagic waters, while foreign vessels retain the right of innocent passage.

According to the _UN Convention_ _on the Law of the Sea_, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) cannot extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines used to measure the width of the territorial sea. A state must formally declare this zone. Within the EEZ, the coastal state holds sovereign rights for the exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing natural resources, both living and non-living (such as minerals), in the sea and on the seabed, as well as for activities undertaken for the economic exploring and exploitation of the zone (e.g., energy production using the sea, marine currents, and winds). The state also has jurisdiction over construction and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research, and the protection and preservation of the marine environment. Fishing within the EEZ is reserved exclusively for the citizens of the coastal state, with an obligation to cooperate, primarily with neighbouring states, for the conservation of certain fish species. If the coastal state is unable to optimally utilize the living resources within its EEZ, it is obliged to allow other states to catch the remaining allowable catch based on agreements and in exchange for compensation. In this process, the coastal state is authorized to determine the allowable catch of living resources within its EEZ and to assess its fishing capacities. The EEZ is not part of the state's territory, although the coastal state enjoys certain sovereign rights that are primarily economic in nature. However, unlike the high seas, the EEZ is not open to all states; the freedoms of the high seas are reduced within this zone in favor of the coastal state.

**The continental shelf** of a coastal state includes the seabed and subsoil beyond the outer boundary of the territorial sea, extending seaward up to the outer limit established by international law. The waters above the continental shelf are not governed by the legal regime of the continental shelf. In the continental shelf, the coastal state exercises sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting the natural resources of the shelf. Natural resources include mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and its subsoil, as well as marine organisms that, at the harvestable stage, are immobile on or under the seabed or can move only in constant physical contact with the seabed or solely within the subsoil.

_The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea_ significantly extended the outer boundary of the continental shelf. Under the 1958 _Convention on the Continental Shelf_, the outer limit of the continental shelf extended to a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that, to the point where the depth of the sea allowed for the exploration and exploitation of natural resources in that area of the seabed. According to the _UN Convention_ _on the Law of the Sea_, however, the outer limit of the continental shelf is defined by the outer edge of the continental margin. _The continental margin_ includes _the continental shelf_ (a strip of seabed that typically drops steeply at a depth of 200 meters), _the continental slope_ (where sea depth averages 1,830 meters), and _the continental rise_ (where sea depth generally ranges from 1,400 meters to 5,000 meters). If the _continental margin_ extends beyond 200 nautical miles, the maximum limit is set at either 350 nautical miles from the baselines or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500-meter isobath, a line connecting points at a depth of 2,500 meters. If the continental margin is narrower than 200 nautical miles, the outer limit of the continental shelf is 200 nautical miles from the baselines used to measure the territorial sea.

To resolve disputes regarding the interpretation and application of _the Convention_, **the** **International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea** was established in Hamburg. In addition, states may also address disputes concerning the law of the sea to the International Court of Justice in The Hague or agree to resolve the dispute through international arbitration.

**The high seas** include marine areas beyond the outer boundaries of territorial seas and archipelagic waters (areas under state sovereignty) and the outer limits of exclusive economic zones (EEZs), which are areas where the coastal state exercises control, jurisdiction, or certain sovereign rights. The high seas also encompass the airspace above, starting from the outer edge of territorial and archipelagic waters and extending seaward. The seabed of the high seas holds a unique legal status based on location: it may be designated as part of the continental shelf or the area, defined as the common heritage of humankind. The high seas are open to all states, coastal and landlocked, and the freedoms of the high seas are exercised according to conditions set by _the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea_ and other rules of international law. For both coastal and landlocked states, these freedoms include:

- freedom of navigation
- freedom of overflight
- freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines
- freedom to construct artificial islands and other installations
- freedom of fishing
- freedom of scientific research.

No state may validly subject any part of the high seas to its sovereignty. Every state, whether coastal or landlocked, has the right for ships bearing its flag to navigate the high seas. Each state determines the conditions under which it grants its nationality to ships, conditions for their registration within its ship registry, and the right to fly its flag. Ships possess the nationality of the state whose flag they are authorized to fly. For ships granted the right to fly its flag, each state issues documentation to that effect.

Ships sail under the flag of only one state and, on the high seas, are subject exclusively to that state's jurisdiction, except in exceptional circumstances expressly provided for in international agreements or in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. A ship may not change its flag during a voyage or when calling at a port, except in the event of an actual transfer of ownership or change in ship registry. According to Article 94 of _the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea_, each state shall effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control over ships flying its flag in administrative, technical, and social matters. Specifically, each state:

- maintains ship registries with names and details of ships flying its flag, except for those ships to which, due to their small size, generally accepted international regulations do not apply;
- exercises jurisdiction over each ship flying its flag, its master, officers, and crew in matters of administration, technical operations, and social issues concerning the ship, in accordance with its domestic law.

Each state, for ships flying its flag, undertakes necessary measures to ensure maritime safety related to the ship's construction, equipment, seaworthiness, working conditions of the crew, use of signaling, communication maintenance, and collision prevention. These measures also include inspections conducted by the flag state's authorized bodies. The flag state must ensure that the master and crew members on its ships are properly qualified to operate the ship, holding all required certifications and knowledge of applicable international regulations, particularly regarding the safety of human life at sea, collision prevention, and protection of the marine environment from pollution.

Each state initiates an investigation, either led by or involving a person or persons with appropriate qualifications, following any maritime accident on the high seas involving a ship flying its flag. Such investigations are conducted in cases where the accident has resulted in loss of life, serious injury to nationals of another state, or significant damage to the ships or installations of another state or to the marine environment. The flag state and any other state concerned cooperate in conducting investigations that the other state undertakes in relation to such maritime incidents or navigational accidents (Article 94, Paragraph 7 of _the Convention_).

Each state requires the master of a ship flying its flag, if the master can do so without serious danger to the ship, crew, or passengers, to:

- render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost;
- if informed of a request for aid, proceed at maximum speed to assist persons in distress, to the extent that such action can be reasonably expected;
- following a collision, provide assistance to the other vessel, its crew, and passengers and, where possible, communicate the name of their own vessel, its port of registry, and the nearest port of call.

Each coastal state promotes the establishment, operation, and maintenance of an appropriate and effective search and rescue service for the safety of life at sea and in the air. When circumstances require, it enters into regional agreements with neighboring states for mutual cooperation.

Unless the intervention is based on authorities granted by a treaty, a warship encountering a foreign vessel on the high seas that is not authorized to claim full immunity may not inspect that vessel unless there is serious reason to suspect:

- that the vessel is engaged in piracy,
- that the vessel is involved in the slave trade,
- that the vessel is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting, and the flag state of the warship has jurisdiction,
- that the vessel is without nationality, or
- that the vessel, although flying a foreign flag or refusing to display its flag, is in fact a vessel of the same nationality as the warship.

If, after inspection, the suspicions are found to be unfounded, the detained vessel is compensated for any loss or damage it has incurred.

Each state takes measures to prevent and punish the transport of slaves on ships authorized to fly its flag and to prevent the unlawful use of its flag for this purpose. All states cooperate in combating illicit drug trafficking or the trade in psychotropic substances conducted by vessels on the high seas.

**The right to pursue** foreign vessels as an international legal institute has emerged from the need to protect the rights and interests of coastal states. In areas where coastal states have certain rights, foreign vessels are obliged to respect the regulations established by these states to safeguard their recognized rights and interests. In cases of violations of these regulations and attempts to evade responsibility by fleeing from maritime areas where coastal states have sovereign rights, practice has established the right to pursue.

Pursuit of a foreign vessel will be undertaken if the competent authority of the coastal state has reasonable grounds to suspect that the foreign vessel or its equipment has violated the legal provisions and other regulations of that state or generally accepted rules of international law.

The pursuit of a foreign vessel may only begin if the suspicious vessel (or its equipment) is located in internal waters, territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, or above the continental shelf, and if it does not stop after a visible or audible signal to halt has been issued from a distance that allows the vessel to see or hear the signal. The pursuit of a foreign vessel may continue in the high seas, exclusive economic zone, or contiguous zone of a foreign state as long as it has not been interrupted and does not enter the territorial sea of its own or any third state. Pursuit of a foreign vessel may begin in the exclusive economic zone or above the continental shelf only if regulations applicable in those zones have been violated.

Pursuit can be carried out by police and military vessels or military aircraft, or other vessels (aircraft) authorized for this purpose. If the pursued vessel is apprehended during the pursuit, the pursuer will hand it over to the competent authority for enforcement of the proceedings. The provisions on pursuit do not apply to foreign military and public vessels that enjoy immunity.

_The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea_ specifically addresses **the protection of the marine environment** and includes a fundamental principle that states are obliged to protect the marine environment. _The Convention_ itself is considered an umbrella treaty because it contains fundamental principles for the protection of the marine environment. It states that it is the general obligation of states to protect and preserve the marine environment. States, either individually or jointly, undertake measures to prevent, reduce, and control pollution of the marine environment. The necessary measures apply to all sources of pollution, not just pollution from ships. _The Convention_ specifically mandates that states adopt international rules and standards to prevent, reduce, and control pollution from ships. The most important international convention for the prevention of marine pollution from ships is MARPOL 73/78, which has been ratified by 161 states, representing more than 99% of the world's gross tonnage.

Regarding the protection of the marine environment and the prevention of pollution, _the Convention_ distinguishes between _flag states, port states,_ and _coastal states_, and specifies their rights and obligations.

**The flag state** takes appropriate measures to prohibit the operation of ships flying its flag if they are not in compliance with the requirements set out in international standards and do not possess valid certificates aligned with international navigation safety standards. Additionally, at the written request of any other state, the flag state is obligated to investigate any alleged violation committed by ships flying its flag. If it is convinced that there is sufficient evidence to initiate proceedings regarding the presumed violation, the flag state must promptly initiate such proceedings in accordance with its national law and inform the requesting state and the relevant international organization of the actions taken and their outcomes (Article 217 of _the Convention_).

**The port state** has the authority to investigate and initiate proceedings for any pollution incident occurring beyond its internal waters, territorial sea, or exclusive economic zone when a ship is voluntarily in one of its ports. Additionally, if a port state finds that a ship in one of its ports has violated international rules and standards for seaworthiness (primarily MARPOL 73/78) and poses a risk to the marine environment, it takes administrative measures, within its capabilities, to prevent the ship from departing. When there is clear and tangible evidence that a ship navigating within a state's exclusive economic zone or territorial sea has violated pollution prevention regulations in the exclusive economic zone, that state may request the ship to provide information regarding its identity, port of registry, last and next port of call, and other relevant information necessary to establish if a violation has occurred (Article 218 of _the Convention_).

**The coastal state** has the authority to initiate proceedings for any breach of its laws and regulations aimed at preventing, reducing, and controlling pollution from ships if the violation occurred within its territorial sea or exclusive economic zone. This includes the right to inspect the vessel and, when the evidence warrants, to initiate proceedings, including detention of the ship (Article 220 of the Convention). In the case of maritime accidents, pollution prevention measures may be taken and enforced beyond the territorial sea, as long as these measures are proportional to the actual damage or threat of damage, in order to protect the coast and related interests (Article 221 of _the Convention_).

To prevent, reduce, and control pollution from ships, coastal states may establish navigation systems within their exclusive economic zone aimed at minimizing the risk of accidents that could lead to marine pollution, including threats to the coastline and related interests. Additionally, within their territorial sea, coastal states may impose further navigational restrictions (e.g., traffic separation schemes and designated shipping lanes), particularly for vessels carrying hazardous or risky cargo, while ensuring minimal interference with the innocent passage of foreign ships. Furthermore, to prevent, reduce, and control marine pollution, a coastal state may set specific conditions for foreign vessels entering its ports, internal waters, or offshore terminals. These conditions must be publicly announced and communicated to the relevant international organization.
