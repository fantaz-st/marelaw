The overall objective of the maritime transport sector in Latvia is to comply with the relevant international and European Union requirements, which is consistently being achieved. The norms of the binding international maritime conventions are mostly directly applicable. If necessary, the requirements set out in international maritime instruments and those of the EU level in the areas of maritime safety, pollution prevention, and maritime traffic efficiency are implemented at the national level through laws and Cabinet Regulations, a brief summary of which is further provided.

## Maritime Administration and Marine Safety Law

The Maritime Administration and Marine Safety Law, adopted in 2002, establishes the state administration institutional system for maritime matters in Latvia. This comprehensive legislation also aims to ensure the implementation of and compliance with binding requirements of international treaties and standards concerning maritime safety and security. The law seeks to safeguard maritime safety, security of ships, ports, and port facilities, and prevent environmental pollution from ships.

**Division A** explains the purpose and application of the Law, namely, the law applies to all vessels registered in the Latvian Ship Register, foreign-flagged vessels located in the Latvian waters, ports and port facilities. The law likewise applies to all natural and legal persons/entities associated with maritime safety. It mandates conformity with international agreements and encompasses the safety of personnel, cargo, navigation and ships. It must be noted that this Law does not apply to the ships of the National Armed Forces and their personnel, nor does it apply to the warships of other states and their personnel. If the norms of international law which are binding on Latvia provide for other provisions than those included in this Law, the norms of international law apply.

**Division B** clarifies the institutions responsible for maritime administration and their respective roles in Latvia. The Ministry of Transport performs the general state administration in maritime matters, for instance, implementation of the state policy and development strategy, ensuring the drafting of laws and regulations pertaining to maritime matters, representing the state in international organizations. The Maritime Administration of Latvia performs a broad spectrum of maritime functions: it registers ships, ships mortgages and maintains the Ship Register; performs inspections of ships; supervises operation of classification societies; issues various conformity certificates; performs port state control; organizes the examination of seafarer qualifications and issues attesting documents; maintains seafarers' certification data base, and many more. There are several other institutions that perform individual functions in maritime matters in accordance with their competence. These institutions are the following: the Coast Guard, the State Environmental Service, the Transport Accident and Incident Investigation Bureau, the State Security Service, the State Border Guard and port authorities.

**Division C** of the Maritime Administration and Marine Safety Law contains detailed provisions relating to various aspects of maritime operations:

- Ship Safety Requirements and Supervision
- Labour Protection of Seafarers
- Maritime Safety and Security in Ports
- Navigation Regime in Latvian Waters
- Marine Casualties and Marine Incidents
- Prevention of Marine Pollution
- Hydrographic Issues and Marine Geospatial Information
- Administrative Offences and Competence in Administrative Offence Proceedings

## Maritime Code

Adopted in 2003, the Maritime Code serves as the foundation of Latvian maritime law, having undergone several amendments over the years - in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020. The Maritime Code consists of eight lettered parts governing both administrative and private legal relations pertinent to legal entities concerning maritime matters.

Unless stated otherwise within its provisions, the Code applies to all ships navigating waters under Latvian jurisdiction, all Latvian ships, and other legal entities associated with Latvian ships or maritime navigation. It explicitly excludes warships and their personnel from its remit. When the binding international law prescribes different provisions from those in the Maritime Code, the international norms prevail. For maritime matters not explicitly governed by the Code, other Latvian laws and regulations take precedence.

The Code covers a broad spectrum of maritime activities.

**Part A** and **Part B** focus on ship registration and the associated rights. It defines a "ship" as any vessel structurally designed for navigation, unless specified otherwise in the Code. It regulates the nationality of ships and the rules for their registration. A ship is considered Latvian if it is registered in the Latvian Ship Register of Maritime Administration of Latvia or the Register of Road Traffic Safety Directorate. Even a ship under construction can be registered in the Ship Register based on the shipbuilding contract. The Code also outlines ship ownership rights and the related securities and restrictions. All amendments and annulments of such rights are also registered in the Ship Register.

**Part C** delves into encumbrances on ships and the arrest of ships, including provisions on ship mortgages, maritime liens, preferential rights of cargo, and special provisions related to ship encumbrances. It also addresses the arrest of ships as a means of securing maritime claims.

**Part D** outlines liability provisions, particularly concerning collisions and limitation of liability. It specifies which claims are subject to liability limitations and allows shipowners to limit their liability by establishing a Fund for Limitation of Liability if such claims are brought to court. The Code includes strict liability for oil pollution, making shipowners liable for pollution-related losses, regardless of fault, and describes the limitation of liability procedures.

**Part E** of the Maritime Code covers the transportation of cargo and passengers, detailing the responsibilities and rights of carriers and consignors, and liability measures. It includes guidelines for issuing bills of lading, required content, types, and liability for including misleading information. Additionally, it encompasses provisions for voyage and time chartering contracts.

**Part F** of the Code deals with salvage operations and the associated properties. These provisions apply unless otherwise agreed upon in salvage contracts. It includes rules regarding salvage rewards and special compensations. Furthermore, this part explains the concept of a wreck, which refers to a ship that has sunk, perished, become stranded, or been abandoned due to an accident at sea, including any objects that were on board. It also addresses the determination of a wreck's hazardousness, procedures for its removal, and the liability of the wreck's owner.

**Part G** focuses on the work and welfare of seafarers on ships flying under the Latvian flag. It covers employment relationships, minimum age for work, work and rest conditions, wage disbursement, hours of work and rest, paid annual leave, and repatriation provisions.

**Part H** includes provisions on mobile constructions, rules on claim prescriptive periods, and administrative offences related to passenger rights on seagoing ships.

## Marine Environment Protection and Management Law

This Law establishes the principles for protecting and managing Latvia's marine environment, aiming to achieve and maintain good marine environmental status. It also promotes sustainable use of the sea and marine ecosystem, as well as the protection, preservation, and sustainable utilization of marine resources as outlined in international agreements binding on Latvia.

The significance of this Law lies in its determination of Latvia's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, including sovereign rights and jurisdiction within these areas. Additionally, it outlines the procedures for Latvia's cooperation with other countries in the Baltic Sea region in the development and implementation of the marine strategy. The Law further specifies the processes for formulating and executing the marine strategy. However, it does not apply to activities conducted in the sea within the framework of national defence or state security safeguarding.

## Law on Ports

This Law sets the principles of port activities and administrative procedures. It contains provisions on port authorities, their functions, structure, financial resources, documents that govern the operation of ports, port regulations, applicable fees, and service charges. It also explains vessel traffic control and the harbour master's role, provides rules on commercial activities in ports, and establishes the Port Development Fund to manage financial resources, support state interests, and enhance the prestige of Latvian ports.
