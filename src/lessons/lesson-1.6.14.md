Maritime pilots play an important role in promoting maritime safety and protecting the marine environment. A marine pilot, also called maritime pilot, harbour pilot, port pilot, ship pilot, or simply pilot, is a mariner who manoeuvres ships through dangerous or congested waters, such as harbours or river mouths. They are navigational experts possessing knowledge of the particular waterway, licensed or authorised by a recognised pilotage authority. It is generally recognized that managing and navigating a ship upon an ocean requires a different set of skills and experience than piloting in confined waterways. In pilotage waters the workload on the bridge increases, the time between error and consequences is reduced to a very short interval, and specialized knowledge in close quarters ship handling and local conditions are required. In the confined or restricted waters of port approaches, where the margins of error are small and the activity intense, most Port States protect their interests by requiring the presence onboard of a local compulsory pilot. Thus, it would be correct to acknowledge that pilotage is service which protects the ship from hazards of the port, but at the same time it protects the ports from the hazards of the ship. According to the criterion of compulsoriness, pilotage can be either compulsory or non-compulsory. In order to ensure the safety of navigation which is the main goal of pilotage, the compulsory pilotage was introduced for certain vessel types and sizes. In addition, national codes specifically exempt vessels that are not subject to mandatory pilotage. These vessels may still choose to use pilotage services voluntarily, but they are not obligated to do so.

Maintaining a strong working relationship between the pilot, the master and the officer in charge of the navigational watch is important for ensuring the safety of shipping. When a ship enters the territorial waters of a Port State, it accepts the sovereign jurisdiction of that state as a condition of entry. Consequently, the Port State establishes the legal and operational framework governing the relationship between the shipowner, the master, and the pilot through its laws and policies. A pilot's authority can only be exercised in cooperation with the master's power to command the crew. Similarly, the master's authority to manage the ship's movements can only be lawfully exercised in co-operation with the pilot's authority to direct and control the navigation of that ship.

Because of the importance of this profession in maritime safety, and to provide effective coordination between pilots and ship personnel it was inevitable to establish practical minimum training standards, certification requirements and operational procedures. International Maritime Organization has recognized the need of individual approach of regulation of marine pilotage in different states. Accordingly, having in mind that each pilotage area needs highly specialized experience and local knowledge, IMO decides not to involve with either the certification or the licensing of pilots or with the systems of pilotage practised in various countries but to barely give recommendations to guide best practices. In 2003, the IMO adopted Resolution A.960(23) containing two Annexes. Annex 1 sets out the Recommendation on Training and Certification of Maritime Pilots other than Deep-sea Pilots, while Annex 2 provides the Recommendation on Operational Procedures for Maritime Pilots other than Deep-sea Pilots.

The recommendation on Training and Certification of Maritime Pilots other than Deep-sea Pilots does not apply to deep-sea pilots or shipmasters or crew who are certificated or licenced to carry out pilotage duties in particular areas. Within the scope of this Recommendation, governments are encouraged to establish or maintain competent pilotage authorities to administer safe and efficient pilotage systems. A competent pilotage authority refers to national or regional governments, or local groups or organizations that, by law or tradition, oversee or provide a pilotage system. The responsibility for assessing the experience, qualifications, and suitability of applicants for pilot certification or licensing lies with each competent pilotage authority. In cooperation with national and local pilots' associations, competent pilotage authorities should also establish entry requirements and develop standards for obtaining a certificate or licence to perform pilotage services within the area under the jurisdiction. Furthermore, they should enforce the maintenance of developed standards and specify whatever prerequisites, experience or examinations are necessary that applicants for certifications or licencing as pilots are properly trained and qualified. Maritime pilot training programmes should be supervised and if any incident should occur it has to be reported and investigated.

Every pilot should hold an appropriate pilotage certificate or licence issued by the competent pilotage authority. In addition to stating the pilotage area for which it is issued, the certificate or licence should also state any requirements or local limitations that the competent pilotage authority may specify such as maximum size, draught or tonnage of vessels that the holder is qualified to pilot.

Each pilot should satisfy the competent pilotage authority that his or her medical fitness -\
particularly eyesight, hearing and physical condition - meets the standards required for\
certification of masters and officers in charge of a navigational watch under the international\
Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as\
amended, or other standards deemed appropriate by the authority.\
If a pilot has experienced a serious injury or illness, there should be a re-evaluation of his\
or her medical fitness prior to return to duty.

The competent pilotage authority is responsible for training and certification or licensing\
standards. Standards for initial training should be designed to develop in the trainee pilot the skills and knowledge determined by the competent pilotage authority necessary for obtaining a pilot certificate or license. The training should include practical experience gained under the close supervision of experienced pilots. This practical experience gained on vessels under actual piloting conditions may be supplemented by simulation, both computer and manned model, classroom instruction, or other training methods. This training should include a requirement for the pilot to assess particular situations and to conduct an exchange of information with the master and/or officer in charge of navigational watch. Maintaining an effective working relationship between the pilot and the bridge team in both routine and emergency conditions should be covered in training. Emergency conditions should include loss of steering, loss of propulsion, and failures of radar, vital systems and automation, in a narrow channel or fairway. Competent pilotage authorities should be encouraged to provide updating and refresher training conducted for certified or licensed pilots to ensure the continuation of their proficiency and updating of their knowledge.

In order to ensure the continued proficiency of pilots and updating of their knowledge, the\
competent pilotage authority should conduct regular evaluations, at intervals not exceeding five years, to verify that all pilots under its jurisdiction continue to possess recent navigational knowledge of the local area to which the certificate of licence applies; continue to meet the medical fitness standards and possess knowledge of the current international, national and local laws, regulations and other requirements and provisions relevant to the pilotage area and the pilots' duties. Area means the waters for which the applicant is to be certified or licensed. Each applicant for a pilot certificate or license should demonstrate that he or she has necessary knowledge of the following:

1. limits of local pilotage areas;
2. International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 as amended, and also, such other national and local navigational safety and pollution prevention rules as may apply in the area;
3. system of buoyage in the area;
4. characteristics of the lights and their angles of visibility and the fog signals, racons and radio beacons and other electronic aids in use in the area;
5. names, positions and characteristics of the light vessels, buoys, beacons, structures and other marks in the area;
6. names and characteristics of the channels, shoals, headlands and points in the area;
7. bridge and similar obstruction limitations including air draughts;
8. depths of water throughout the area, including tidal effects and similar factors;
9. general set, rate, rise and duration of the tides and use of the tide tables and real-time and current data systems, if available, for the area;
10. proper courses and distances in the area;
11. anchorages in the area;
12. ship handling for piloting, anchoring, berthing and unberthing, manoeuvring with and without tugs, and emergency situations;
13. communications and availability of navigational information;
14. systems of radio navigational warning broadcasts in the area and the type of information likely to be included;
15. traffic separation schemes, vessel traffic services and similar vessel management systems in the area;
16. bridge equipment and navigational aids;
17. use of radar and other electronic devices; their limitations and capabilities as navigation and collision avoidance aids;
18. manoeuvring behaviour of the types of ships expected to be piloted and the limitations imposed by particular propulsion and steering systems;
19. factors affecting ship performance such as wind, current, tide, channel configuration, water depth, bottom, bank and ship interaction including squat;
20. use and limitation of various types of tugs;
21. the English language to a standard adequate to enable the pilot to express communications clearly;
22. IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases;
23. IMO Code for the investigation of marine casualties and incidents;
24. Master-Pilot Relationship, Pilot Card, operational procedures;
25. pollution prevention;
26. emergency and contingency plans for the area;
27. safe embarking and disembarking procedures; and
28. other relevant knowledge considered necessary.

Efficient pilotage depends, among other things, upon the effectiveness of the communications and information exchanges between the pilot, the master and the bridge personnel and upon the mutual understanding each has for the functions and duties of the other. It is essential to achieve effective co-ordination between the pilot, the master and the bridge personnel, taking due account of the ship's systems and equipment available to the pilot, because it can aid a safe and expeditious passage. Annex 2 of Resolution with its Recommendation on Operational Procedures for Maritime Pilots other than Deep-sea Pilots emphasizes the importance of pilots for maritime security, without underestimating master's position. Although the pilot has exclusive control and conduct of the ship, this does not mean the command of her. The master's position and authority on board a piloted vessel remain unchanged. The master retains the command over the vessel and has always the power and authority to interfere with the pilot's actions. This interference, however, must be clear and decisive, an act either revoking the pilot's order or correcting and modifying it. Even when a pilot is on board and in control of the ship's navigation, the master remains responsible for the vessel, persons and cargo on board and the safety of navigation. It is, moreover, the master's duty to state unequivocally his opinion regarding the pilot's manoeuvres and when he deems it necessary, he must correct or alter the pilot's orders. There is no question, therefore, of divided command and authority. Recommendation on Operational Procedures for Maritime Pilots other than Deep-sea Pilots prescribe that the pilot's presence on board does not relieve the master or officer in charge of the navigational watch from their duties and obligations for the safety of the ship. This provision has its base in STCW, section A-VIII, part 4-1, paragraph 49.

The master and the pilot shall exchange information regarding navigation procedures, local conditions and the ship's characteristics. The master and/or the officer in charge of the navigational watch shall co-operate closely with the pilot and maintain an accurate check on the ship's position and movement. If in any doubt as to the pilot's actions or intentions, the officer in charge of the navigational watch shall seek clarification from the pilot and, if doubt still exists, shall notify the master immediately and take whatever action is necessary before the master arrives. The Master has both the right and duty to intervene and displace the pilot in circumstances where the pilot is manifestly incompetent or incapacitated or the ship is in immediate danger due to the pilot's actions or intentions.

It is of crucial importance for the pilot, the master and the bridge personnel to clearly understand their respective roles in the safe passage of the ship before the pilotage commences. During pilotage, masters and bridge officers have a duty to support the pilot while also continuously monitoring his or her actions to ensure safety. It is essential for pilots to be adequately rested and mentally alert in order to provide undivided attention to pilotage duties for the duration of the passage.

The appropriate competent pilotage authority should establish and promulgate the location of safe pilot embarkation and disembarkation points that should be at a sufficient distance from the commencement of the act of pilotage to allow safe boarding conditions. The appropriate competent pilotage authority should, also, establish, promulgate and maintain procedures for requesting a pilot for an inbound or outbound ship, or for shifting a ship.

The master and the pilot should exchange information regarding navigational procedures, local conditions and rules and the ship's characteristics. Each competent pilotage authority should develop a standard exchange of information practice, taking into account regulatory requirements and best practices in the pilotage area. Accordingly, pilots should consider using an information card, form, checklist or other memory aid to ensure that essential exchange items are covered. If information card or standard form is used by pilots locally regarding the anticipated passage, the layout of such a card or form should be easy to understand. Anyhow, the card or form should supplement and assist, but not be considered as substitute for the verbal information exchange. Pilots should be familiar with the IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases and use them in appropriate situations during radio communications as well as during verbal exchanges on the bridge. This will enable the master and officer in charge of the navigational watch to better understand communication and the intent. Communication on board between the pilot and bridge watchkeeping personnel should be conducted in the English language or in a language other than English that is common to all those involved in the operation. This procedure, however, is sometimes dispensed with when the helmsman understands the pilot's language, allowing the pilot to give direct orders to the helmsman. When a pilot is communicating with external parties, such as vessel traffic services, tugs or linesmen and is unable to communicate in English or a language understood on the bridge, the pilot should, as soon as practicable, explain what was said. This ensures that the bridge personnel can monitor and understand any subsequent actions taken by those external parties.

Pilots and competent pilotage authorities should be aware of the voyage planning responsibilities of masters regulated by applicable IMO instruments SOLAS regulation V/34 and resolution A.893(21) on Guidelines for voyage planning and STCW Code, Section A-VIII/2, Part 2 regarding watchkeeping arrangements and principles to be observed. The need for voyage and passage planning applies to all vessels. SOLAS regulation V/34 prescribes the duty of the master to ensure, prior to proceeding to sea, that the intended voyage has been planned using the appropriate nautical charts and nautical publications for the area concerned, considering the guidelines and recommendations developed by the IMO. The voyage plan will identify a route that takes into account any relevant ships' routeing systems; ensures sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the ship throughout the voyage; anticipates all known navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions; and considers the marine environmental protection measures that apply, and avoids, as far as possible, actions and activities which could cause damage to the environment. Voyage and passage planning is regulated more precisely by Guidelines aforementioned. These Guidelines state that voyage and passage planning include appraisal, i.e., gathering all information relevant to the contemplated voyage or passage; detailed planning of the whole voyage or passage from berth to berth, including those areas necessitating the presence of a pilot; execution of the plan; and the monitoring of the progress of the vessel in the implementation of the plan. In accordance with Section A-VIII/2 of the STCW Code, the intended voyage must be planned in advance taking into consideration all pertinent information. Prior to each voyage the master of every ship shall ensure that the intended route from the port of departure to the first port of call is planned using adequate and appropriate charts and other nautical publications necessary for the intended voyage, containing accurate, complete and up-to-date information regarding those navigational limitations and hazards which are of a permanent or predictable nature, and which are relevant to the safe navigation of the ship. If a decision is made, during a voyage, to change the next port of call of the planned route, or if it is necessary for the ship to deviate substantially from the planned route for other reasons, then an amended route shall be planned prior to deviating substantially from the route originally planned.

When performing pilotage duties, the pilot is responsible for reporting, or ensuring the report of, any observations that may affect the safety of navigation or pollution prevention to the appropriate authority. This includes promptly reporting any accident involving the piloted ship and any irregularities with navigational lights, shapes, or signals. Besides having duties and responsibilities, pilots also have certain rights while performing their work. One of their most important rights is the one that entitles them to refuse pilotage when the ship to be piloted poses a danger to the safety of navigation or the environment. Any such refusal, along with the reasons for it, should be immediately reported to the appropriate authority for further action. Likewise, if the pilot is manifestly incompetent, intoxicated, otherwise incapacitated, or if the pilot's actions are placing the ship in dear and imminent danger the master can intervene and if the safety of the ship is in jeopardy, he has a duty to intervene. If the master displaces the pilot, the ship cannot proceed independently; instead, the master must request another pilot or resolve the issues with the pilot onboard before continuing. In addition, paragraph 50 of the STCW, section VIII/2, part 4-1, prescribes that if in any doubt as to the pilot's actions or intentions, the officer in charge of the navigational watch shall seek clarification from the pilot and, if doubt still exists, shall notify the master immediately and take whatever action is necessary before the master arrives.

It is important to underline that the shipowner is generally liable for the consequences of negligent navigation even when the ship is under pilotage. The shipowner could still remain liable to third parties for damage caused by the pilot's negligence, regardless of whether the pilotage was compulsory or not. This principle set forth in the 1910 Collision Convention for collision damage has been widely accepted in maritime law even for other causes of loss or damage. This is consistent with the concept that the master retains command of navigation, even when a pilot is present onboard. While the pilot is considered an agent of the shipowner when acting within the scope of their authority, and the crew is obligated to obey the pilot, the pilot does not supersede the master's authority. The master remains ultimately responsible for the vessel and its navigation. Unless the shipowner is personally at fault or guilty of an act or omission in causing damage to third parties, they may limit the liability. With respect to the contractual liability of a pilot toward the owner of the piloted vessel, liability may fall on the pilot personally or on the firm or professional association (such as the pilotage authority). They may be held liable for damages caused by the pilot's negligence to the piloted vessel. Additionally, in cases where the shipowner is compelled to compensate third parties for damages resulting from the pilot's negligence, the shipowner may have the right to seek recourse from the pilot or their organization for those damages.
