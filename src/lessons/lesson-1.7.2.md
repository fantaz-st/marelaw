**Explains that "Port State Control" is the inspection of foreign ships present in a nation's port for the purpose of verifying that the condition of the ships and their equipment comply with the provisions of international conventions and codes, and that the ships are manned and operated in compliance with those provisions.**

As established by the IMO, Port State Control (PSC) consists in the evaluation of foreign vessels upon mooring in national ports, in order to verify that the condition of the vessel, its equipment and crew comply with the requirements established in international regulations. It is one of the most effective instruments of preventive maritime safety.

There are numerous fundamental IMO technical conventions, which incorporate provisions requiring the inspection of ships when visiting foreign ports, thus ensuring their compliance with IMO standards. Resolution A.682(17) was adopted to promote regional cooperation in the control of ships and discharges by encouraging the conclusion of regional agreements. Since ships bound for a port in one country often visit other countries in the same region, closely coordinating inspections becomes more efficient, focusing on those ships that do not comply with standards and avoiding multiple inspections.

This ensures that as many ships as possible are inspected, as well as preventing unnecessary delays caused by redundant inspections. Although the primary responsibility for ship standards rests with the flag state, port state control creates a "safety net" to identify substandard vessels. Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) have been established for this purpose.

**Explains that the primary responsibility for maintaining ship's standards rests with their flag States, as well as their owners and Masters. However, many flag States control do not, for various reasons, fulfil their obligations under international maritime conventions, and port State control provides a useful "safety net" to catch substandard ships.**

The European Commission states in the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port State control" that the primary responsibility for monitoring compliance with IMO and ILO standards lies with the flag State of the ship. However, the flag State rules apply to the flag of the ship, so there are some States that have allowed substandard ships even incapable of complying with international regulations to operate under their flags. That is why many of the most important IMO technical conventions contain provisions for ships to be inspected when visiting foreign ports to ensure that they meet international requirements.
In order to establish a more exhaustive control, the Erika legislative packages of the European Union are created, aimed at improving safety in the shipping industry and thus reducing environmental damage to the oceans. We refer to it as a legislative package because it is comprised of three blocks, Erika I, which comprises amendments to existing legislation; Erika II, on innovations in EU legislation; and Erika III, which integrates international standards with EU legislation.

Erika III addresses maritime safety, civil liability and flag states, establishes Directive 2009/16/EC on port state control of ships. This aims to reduce substandard shipping in EU waters. It aims to ensure that ships comply with both EU and international maritime safety and environmental standards. It also establishes common criteria for ship inspections. It establishes a risk profile, so that each ship, depending on its type, age, flag, company history and detention history, is inspected with the mandatory minimum frequency.

One of the key points is the risk profile assigned through the **THETIS database (The Hybrid European Targeting and Inspection System)**. THETIS, is a port state control information system, which allows EU port state authorities and Paris Memorandum of Understanding countries to manage inspection data in a single interface. It does this by establishing risk profiles and thus establishes which ships should be inspected and allows the results to be recorded. The program automatically indicates inspection priorities to the maritime administration and port PSC inspectors. Through THETIS these reports are available to all PSC authorities in the EU and the Paris MoU region. To facilitate the planning of inspections, the system is linked to the SafeSeaNet20 (SSN) system, which provides information on ships in Member States' ports.

**States that a "port state control regime", where set up under a "memorandum of understanding" ("MOU") or similar accord between neighbouring port States, is a system of harmonized inspection procedures designed to target substandard ships with the main objective being their eventual elimination form the region covered by the MOU's participating States.**

In order to improve the effectiveness of PSC port state controls, regional coordination between different countries was initiated. The Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Port State Control is the first of 9 such MoUs. The member countries of the European Economic Area with seaports, as well as Canada, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, are signatories to the MoU.

The Commission, together with the European Maritime Safety Agency, provides criteria to the Paris MoU and the European Economic Area in order to discern which ships to inspect and promote. In this way the procedures and instruments given by the MoU, are adopted by the PSC directive, based on concepts of cargo sharing and specific and harmonized inspections.

Paris Mou arose from a growing need to reinforce legislation on the safety of navigation, generated by the grounding of the tanker "Amoco Cadiz". This is the consequence of a failure of the steering gear, resulting in the sixth largest oil spill in history, with some 230,000 tons before its entry into force (March 1982), off the coast of Brittany in March 1978. Thus, through a harmonized system of port state control, the signatory countries are committed to the elimination of substandard ships.

Around the same time that this disaster occurred, the maritime authorities of a number of Western European countries were developing the so-called "Hague Memorandum", which was essentially linked to living and working conditions on board ships, following the requirements established by the 1947 ILO Convention.

However, in view of the consequences of the accident, it was necessary to establish a more comprehensive and effective memorandum than the existing one, covering aspects such as the safety of human life at sea and the prevention of marine pollution, as well as living and working conditions on board ships. Thus the "Paris Memorandum of Understanding" came into being.

The duties to which they are committed by the Paris MoU (Section 1) are:

- Implement the provisions of the MoU,
- Maintain an effective PSC system,
- Achieve 25% of inspections,
- Consult, cooperate and exchange information with other Authorities, and
- Establish a procedure to receive information from pilots and port authorities.

**States that there are eight international PSC agreement a particular port State might be party to and any areas of particular focus that may currently be in place.**

The eight international PSC agreements to which a particular port state could be a party and areas of particular focus that may currently be in force.

According to IMO, there are ten PSC regimes, comprising 9 regional Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and one Port State Control Agreement covering specific regions and the U.S. Coast Guard, which is the tenth PSC regime. Some countries belong to more than one of these regimes.

The structure of a regional PSC regime is as follows:

- Port State Control Committee
- Secretariat
- Database or information system.

Each holds an annual meeting with cooperating members and observer organizations (such as IMO, which is an observer in all regional PSC regimes).

The PSC consists in delegating control and inspection powers to state authorities in relation to foreign vessels disembarked in their ports for commercial reasons.

The common principles of some PSC inspection procedures, are:

- Verification of documents: certificates, boat and crew licenses.
- Verification of safety equipment: verification of lifeboats, firefighting equipment and navigation equipment. The condition of these will be checked and that the crew knows how to use them.
- Verification of structural integrity: no cracks, leaks or other damage.
- Verification of machinery: engines, generators and other mechanical equipment, check their condition and that the crew knows how to operate them.
- Verification of the crew's living conditions: accommodation, food and hygiene, that they are rested and that their living conditions are safe and healthy.
- Verification of environmental compliance: that the vessel complies with environmental regulations, including wastewater discharge and marine pollution.

**Explains that the port State control inspections may be conducted on the following basis:**

1. **Initiative of the port State Administration:**
2. **The request of, or on the basis of, information regarding a ship provided by another Administration;**
3. **Information regarding a ship provided by a member of the crew, a professional body, an association, a trade union or any other individual with an interest in the safety of the ship, its crew and passengers, or the protection of the maritime environment.**

This is set out in Chapter 2 on Port State Inspections in IMO Resolution A.1155(32) - Port State Control Procedures, 2021 - (Adopted 15 December 2021).

**States that the definition of more detailed inspection is: "An inspection conducted when there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ships, its equipment, or its crew does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificates"**

This statement is based on Regulation 6, Chapter I of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which sets out the procedures to be followed when a designated surveyor or a recognised organisation finds that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not substantially conform with the particulars in the certificate, or is such that the ship cannot proceed to sea without danger to the ship or persons on board.

According to the same article, when such a substantial discrepancy is found either in the condition of the ship, the crew or the certificate, the surveyor is obliged to take certain measures immediately, as well as to carry out a more extensive inspection arising from the situation at hand. Failure to do so will result in the certificate being withdrawn and the Administration concerned being notified of the situation.

**States that the definition of Clear grounds is: "Evidence that the ship, it equipment, or its crew does not correspond substantially with the requirements of the relevant conventions or that the Master or crew members are not familiar with essential shipboard procedures relating to the safety of ships or the prevention of pollution".**

Regulation 4, Chapter XI-1, C. SOLAS. When a ship is in a port of another country that is also a party to the treaty, it may be inspected by authorities designated by that country. This supervision focuses on making sure that the master and crew are familiar with crucial shipboard procedures related to the safety of the ship. The inspection is carried out if there is clear evidence that the crew is not fully informed about these essential procedures.

**Outlines that "Clear grounds" to conduct a more detailed inspection include:**

1. **The absence of principal equipment or arrangements required by the conventions;**
2. **Evidence from a review of the ship's certificates that a certificate or certificates are clearly invalid;**
3. **Evidence that document required by the conventions are not on board, incomplete, are not maintained or are falsely maintained;**
4. **Evidence from the PSCO's general impressions and observations that serious hull or structural deterioration or deficiencies exist that may place at risk the structural, watertight or weathertight integrity of the ship;**
5. **Evidence from the PSCO's general impressions and observations that serious hull or structural deterioration or deficiencies exist in the safety, pollution prevention or navigational equipment;**
6. **Information or evidence that the Master or crew is not familiar with essential shipboard operations relating to the safety of ships or the prevention of pollution, or that such;**
7. **Indications that key crew members may not be able to communicate with each other or with other persons on board;**
8. **The emission of false distress alerts not followed by proper cancellation procedures;**
9. **Receipt of a report or complaint complaining information that a ship appears to be substandard;**

_"When a PSCO inspects a foreign ship which is required to hold a convention certificate, and which is in a port or an offshore terminal under the jurisdiction of the port State, any such inspection should be limited to verifying that there are on board valid certificates and other relevant documentation and the PSCO forming an impression of the overall condition of the ship, its equipment and its crew, unless there are "clear grounds" for believing that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificates_."

The above points are 9 clear reasons why an inspection should be performed.

**Explains that the PSCO during a more detailed inspection generally takes the following into account;**

The Paris MoU, "Guidance on type of inspections", point 2.3 sets out the following points as guidance on areas not covered by the specific PSCCInstruction.

- **Structure:** a PSCO's (Port State Control Officer) decision on whether to carry out a thorough inspection of a ship's structure will be influenced by the maintenance impression of the hull and the general condition of the deck. The PSCO will also pay attention to structural integrity and seaworthiness. The assessment will be based on on-board reports, which should include structural inspection reports, condition assessments, thickness measurement reports and a survey planning document.
- **Machinery spaces:** The PSCO will assess the condition of the machinery and electrical installations so that they can provide sufficient power for propulsion and auxiliary service. Although this cannot be properly assessed without running the machinery, general deficiencies will be assessed. If there are indications of negligence, the scope of the investigation will be expanded to include certain tests.
- **Conditions of assignment of load lines:** although the PSCO may have decided that a hull inspection is not necessary, he will focus on detailing the deck inspection if there are concerns about such things as defective hatch closures, corroded air pipes and ventilation coamings. Particular attention will be paid to the condition of cargo line assignments, examining locking devices, deck water evacuation systems and provisions for crew protection.
- **Life-saving appliances:** The effectiveness of **life-saving** appliances depends to a large extent on good maintenance by the crew and their use in regular drills, therefore it is necessary that inspections are carried out on a regular basis.
- **Fire safety:** The PSCO will review the shipboard fire control plan in order to obtain an overview of the fire safety measures planned for the ship and consider its compliance with the requirements of the Convention for the year of construction.
- **Regulations for preventing collisions at sea;** Based on observations on deck, the PSCO will consider the need for close inspection of lanterns and their screening and means of making sound and distress signals.
- **Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate;** The general condition of the ship may lead the PSCO to consider issues other than those related to safety equipment and load line assignment, but nevertheless associated with the safety of the ship.
- **Cargo Ship Radio Certificates;** The requirements for radio equipment maintenance are contained in SOLAS.
- **Equipment in excess of convention or flag State requirements;** Equipment on board which is expected to be relied on in situations affecting safety or pollution prevention must be in operating condition.
- **Guideline for discharge requirements under Annexes I and III of MARPOL 73/78 which includes:**
  - **Inspection of crude oil washing (COW) operations;**
  - **Inspection of unloading, striping and prewash operations;**
  - **Guidelines for control of operational requirements -- which include:**
    - **Muster list;**
    - **Communication**
    - **Fire drills**
    - **Abandon ship drills;**
    - **Damage control plan and Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan;**
    - **Fire control plan**
    - **Bridge operation**
    - **Cargo operation**
    - **Operation of the machinery**
    - **Manuals, instructions etc.;**
    - **Oil and oily mixtures machinery spaces;**
    - **Loading, unloading and cleaning procedures for cargo spaces of tankers**
    - **Dangerous goods and harmful substances in packaged form;**
    - **Garbage**
  - **Minimum manning standards and certification;**
  - **STCW 78**
  - **ISM; and**
  - **ISPS Code**

**States that the expanded inspection is an inspection conducted according to non-mandatory guidelines only once during 12-month period for certain types of ships and certain categories of age and size.**

"High Risk Ships (HRS) and ships of a risk type (chemical tanker, gas carrier, oil tanker, NLS tanker, bulk carrier and passenger ship) and more than 12 years old are eligible for an expanded inspection.

An expanded inspection shall include a check of the overall condition, including the human element where relevant. And, subject to their practical feasibility or any constraints relating to the safety of persons, the ship or the port, verification of the specific items in the risk areas for each ship type must be part of an expanded inspection."

**Explains that oil tankers, bulk carriers, gas and chemical carriers and passenger ships are subject to expanded inspections once during a period of 12 months.**

"High Risk Ships (HRS) and ships of a risk type (chemical tanker, gas carrier, oil tanker, NLS tanker, bulk carrier and passenger ship) and more than 12 years old are eligible for an expanded inspection."

Article 7 of "COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995" establishes that "type chemical tanker, gas carrier, oil tanker, NLS tanker, bulk carrier and passenger ship" are subject to an expanded inspection by any port authority of the Member States once every 12 months.

**Outlines the IMO RESOLUTIONS pertaining to State Controls are as follows:**

- **A.9/Res.321 Procedures for the control of fhips 12/11/1975**
- **A.15/Res.597 Amendments to the procedures for the control of ships 19/11/1987**
- **A.19/Res.787 Procedures for port state control 23/11/1995**
- **A.21/Res. 882 Amendments to the procedures for the port state control (resolution A.787 (19) 25/11/1999)**

"Following the continuous updating of the Procedures for PSC carried out by the Correspondence and Working Groups on Measures to Harmonized Port State Control (PSC) Activities and Procedures Worldwide, an Assembly resolution containing an updated version of the Procedures for PSC is adopted every two years."

These resolutions are important tools for maritime regulation and enforcement, ensuring that ships meet safety and quality standards when entering ports and waters under the jurisdiction of IMO member states.

**States that the publication by IMO which gives General Procedural Guidelines for Port State Control Officers are also of particular relevance to shipmaster.**

International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea of October 20, 1972, and other complementary rules such as local customs, etc., being noteworthy in this regard the 2nd rule paragraph a) of the International Regulations which literally states "nothing in these Regulations shall exempt a ship, or its owner, the master or the crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect in complying with these Regulations or of neglecting to observe any precaution that may be required by normal seafaring practice or the special circumstances of the case".

Thus, the consequences of not complying with the established requirements on maritime safety and environment established by the Port State Control fall on the master.

**Explains that a record of Port State Control inspections including safety-related details of many ships is available on the internet form Equasis databases and may be viewed by any member of the public. **

The Quality Shipping Campaign, launched in 1997 by the European Commission and the UK Government, focused on improving quality and safety in shipping through the collaboration of all industry players. It highlighted the lack of transparency of information on the quality of ships and operators as a key obstacle. The Quality Shipping Conference in 1998 generated a unanimous call to make information more accessible.

In response, the European Commission and the French Maritime Administration cooperated to develop Equasis, an online information system. Key principles included its focus on ship safety, its non-commercial nature, global coverage, active cooperation with the maritime industry and voluntary use without legal pressure. Thus, Equasis seeks to improve transparency and provide unbiased information for better decision making in shipping.

**Explains that Equasis forms part of the Quality Shipping campaign launched by the EU in 1997 which is formally supported by signatories form marine Administrations, classification societies, P&I clubs and the ITF.**

"The role of the industry in promoting quality and safety in marine transport was at the heart of the Quality Shipping Campaign, launched by the European Commission and the UK Government in November 1997. The Campaign's aim was to bring together all players involved in the various fields of marine business in an effort to improve maritime safety. It was based upon dialogue between all the marine industry and public authorities and its tools were, primarily, voluntary measures. As the Quality Shipping Campaign demonstrated, one of the greatest impediments to a genuine quality culture in shipping is the lack of transparency in the information relating to the quality of ships and their operators."

**Explains that more than 40 organizations provide information to Equasis and is used heavily by charters and insurers as well as marine Administrations with port State control functions.**

Equasis aims to collect and disseminate high quality information related to maritime safety. It provides information from both public authorities and industry organizations. The aim is to provide an unbiased and transparent exchange of information, which allows stakeholders in the maritime transport sector to be better informed about the performance of ships and to have information about the organizations they deal with.
