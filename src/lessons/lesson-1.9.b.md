Spanish maritime law is composed of three levels of rules:

1. The international conventions ratified by Spain, as well as the rules issued by European institutions.
2. The two primary national laws governing maritime activities: The Law on State Ports and the Merchant Navy (2011), and the Act on Maritime Navigation (2014).
3. A set of regulations issued by the Government that elaborate on specific matters regulated by the aforementioned conventions and laws.

## International Conventions ratified by Spain:

Spain, as an active member of the international maritime community, has ratified the main international conventions regulating safety, navigation, responsibility and protection of the marine environment. These conventions have been approved by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO); as well as within the framework of the United Nations.

Among the main ones, the SOLAS Convention, MARPOL Convention, LL Convention, COLREG, UNCLOS, BUNKERS 2001, OPRC, Hong Kong Convention 2009, SAR Convention, CSC, International Convention on Maritime Privileges and Ship Mortgages, Maritime Labor Convention (MLC), International Convention on the Arrest of Ships 1999, Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks 2007, International Convention on Salvage, 1989, etc. can be cited.

## Act 14/2014, dated 24th July, on Maritime Navigation:

The entry into force of this Law marked a milestone in the history of Spanish maritime law, with the adoption of a new unitary legal regime for the main institutions of maritime navigation, which eliminated the content of the outdated Book III of the Code of Commerce of 1885, which was repealed, adapting maritime navigation legislation to international reality and practices.

Among other matters, the law unified the regulation of legal institutions relating to ships and their legal status, maritime privileges, ship mortgages, shipowners, masters, and crew. It also covered various maritime contracts, including the carriage of goods under a bill of lading, charter parties, the carriage of passengers, bareboat charters, towing, nautical charters, ship management, ship agency, pilotage, and port handling. Additionally, it addressed maritime accidents, limitation of liability, maritime insurance, and procedural specialties, such as ship arrest and the notarization of certain maritime law cases.

With regard to the maritime transport of goods, whether national or international, under a bill of lading regime and the carrier's liability, Article 277.2 of the Law establishes that these shall be governed by the Hague-Visby Rules. This is without prejudice to Spain's status as a signatory to the Rotterdam Rules.

The legislator opted for a single law which provides maritime navigation with a modern legal framework, adapted to the needs of current maritime traffic while providing the sector with the legal certainty it lacked. This decision to tackle the reform by means of a single law, as opposed to the opposite option of issuing multiple and scattered special laws, was a wise decision, since a single law is preferable in order to guarantee the unity of the system. In this way, the harmonious and integrated application of the same is facilitated, with the possibility of filling its gaps by resorting to analogy, and to civil and general commercial law.

Therefore, in essence, the purpose of the Act on Maritime Navigation is to regulate the legal situations and relationships arising from maritime navigation. This encompasses navigation on seas, rivers, canals, lakes, and natural or artificial reservoirs that are accessible to ships from the sea up to the point where tidal effects are felt and navigable stretches of rivers up to ports of general interest. Apart from these cases, navigation in inland waters is governed by legislation on the public water domain and other applicable provisions.

It's important to point out that the Act 14/2014 will be applied as long as it does not oppose the international treaties in force in Spain and the EU rules that regulate the same matter. So, EU rules have preference in application. In the absence of any other, the complementary laws and regulations and the uses and customs on maritime navigation will be considered. In the absence of all of the above and if 'analogy' cannot be used, ordinary law will be applied.

## Law on State Ports and the Merchant Navy:

Royal Legislative Decree 2/2011, of 5 September, approving the Consolidated Text of the Law on State Ports and the Merchant Navy (TRLPEMM), finally fulfilled the mandate given to the Government to recast the main regulations in force on port and merchant navy law. The 320 articles of the TRLPEMM are organized in a preliminary title and three books; the first dedicated to the State-owned port system; the second to the Merchant Navy; and the third, common to both matters, establishes the maritime and port police regime. In addition to these, there are 33 additional provisions, 8 transitory provisions, 4 final provisions and 3 annexes.

The TRLPEMM is the result of the recasting, in a single law, essentially of two previous laws: the former Law 27/1992, of 24 November, on State Ports and the Merchant Navy, and Law 48/2003, of 26 November, on the economic regime and the provision of services in ports of interest. The TRLPEMM, which was published in the Official State Gazette number 253 of 20 October 2011 came into force on 21 October 2011. After its entry into force, these legal regulations that were recast, were expressly declared repealed.

In short, the purpose of the law is none other than: a) to determine and classify the ports that are the responsibility of the General State Administration; b) to regulate the planning, construction, organization, management, economic-financial regime and policing of these ports; c) to regulate the provision of services in these ports, as well as their use, d) to determine the State port organization, providing ports of general interest with a system of functional and management autonomy; e) to establish the regulatory framework of the Merchant Navy, f) to regulate the Administration of the Merchant Navy; g) to establish the system of infringements and penalties applicable in the area of the Merchant Navy and in the port area under State jurisdiction.

## Some of the regulations approved by the Government in development of maritime law institutions regulated by higher-ranking rules:

**Regulation on the Ordination of Maritime Navigation:**

Royal Decree 186/2023, of 21 March, approving the Regulation on the Ordination Maritime Navigation, was adopted with the aim of updating and improving the control and regulation of maritime traffic in Spain. Its objectives are to ensure the safety of navigation, the protection of the marine environment and compliance with national and international regulations. It is based on the need to modernize procedures that traditionally involved physical inspections and manual documentary checks, replacing them with more efficient digital systems.

The regulation also introduces changes to the procedure for ship clearance, establishing three modalities:

1. Ordinary clearance, which can be done with a responsible declaration or with express authorization in cases of risk.
2. Self-dispatch, in exceptional situations where the master of the ship assumes responsibility.
3. Simplified regime, applicable to recreational craft and short distance vessels, facilitating their operation.

In addition, other key aspects of navigation are regulated, such as the authorization of entry and exit of vessels in Spanish waters, the management of anchoring of vessels in the event of breakdown or _force majeure_, and the prevention of polluting discharges by vessels in transit. It also establishes rules on commercial operations outside port limits, which until now lacked specific regulation generating legal uncertainty for companies in the sector.

In conclusion, this regulation simplifies and modernizes Spanish maritime regulations, integrating digital procedures and eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy. Its purpose is to guarantee greater safety, environmental protection and efficiency in the management of maritime traffic, adapting to international and European standards. It also seeks to avoid the dispersion of rules, concentrating key aspects for navigation in Spanish waters in a single regulation.

Notwithstanding the above, it is important to bear in mind that the regulation has not yet fully entered into force. Although most of its provisions are applicable from 11/04/2023, some key aspects, such as the regime of ship dispatch, the dispatch and manning list, and the system of enrolment and disenrollment of crew members, will not be enforceable until 15 August 2025. This means that, until that date, certain regulations will remain under the previous regulatory framework, requiring a progressive transition to the new system.
