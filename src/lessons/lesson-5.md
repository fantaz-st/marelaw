## International Convention on Salvage, 1989 (The London Salvage Convention)

**Salvage** is a specific maritime legal institution that involves actions aimed at mitigating the danger to persons and property arising from maritime navigation. Salvage activity concerns the preservation and protection of a ship, other property, and persons on board from dangers related to maritime navigation, which could result in the loss of life or property. In a salvage operation involving property (such as a ship, cargo, etc.), a property relationship is formed, within which, provided the salvage operation has a beneficial result, one party claims a reward for the salvage, and the other party owes that reward. No reward is owed for the salvage of human life.

The entirety of salvage operations is regulated by administrative and property law provisions. The obligation to provide salvage services is stipulated by administrative regulations. These regulations are applied where there is a clear public interest, particularly evident in the rescue of human lives, and more recently, in the protection of the marine environment. Unlike the mandatory rescue of human lives, the salvage of property establishes obligatory relationships governed by property law provisions, particularly in regard to issues such as the right to a salvage reward, the distribution of the reward among multiple salvors, the criteria for determining the reward amount, and similar matters.

As with other maritime law institutes, the legal sources of salvage are divided into _legislative_ and _autonomous sources_. Legislative sources include laws and other regulations issued by a legislator, as the name suggests. These regulations can be national or international, with the latter comprising salvage provisions contained in international conventions ratified by a state's legislative body. There are two international conventions on salvage that regulate property law relations and two that contain administrative regulations. The property law conventions are the _International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea_, 1910, from Brussels, and the newer, currently in force _International Convention on Salvage_ 1989, London (_Convention on Salvage_ 1989 or *Salvage Convention *1989).

The administrative regulations are contained in the _International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea,_ 1974, as amended (SOLAS), and the _International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue,_ 1979 (SAR Convention).

Autonomous salvage law is embodied in standardized salvage contract forms. Autonomous legal sources include the general terms of professional salvors and the terms of salvage contract forms, the most notable of which is the widely recognized and internationally accepted British _Lloyd's Standard Form of Salvage Agreement_ (_Lloyd's Open Form - LOF_).

The fundamental principle of property law in salvage is **_no cure -- no pay_**, which means that a reward is owed only for a successful salvage outcome; success in the salvage operation is a constitutive element of salvage. This principle, as a classic tenet of salvage law, also characterizes modern salvage law. Traditionally, most legal systems have required a positive result as a prerequisite for earning a salvage reward. The right to a reward has been based on the principle that if a salvor, through their efforts and endeavours, secures a benefit for the owner of the endangered property, they should be rewarded for it. The _no cure -- no pay_ principle is the cornerstone of the _International Convention on Salvage_ and the _Lloyd's Open Form of Salvage Agreement (LOF)_ in all its editions.

The _International Convention on Salvage_ was adopted at a diplomatic conference in London in 1989 and entered into force in 1996 after being ratified by 15 states. According to the Convention, **salvage (salvage operation)** encompasses any act or activity undertaken to assist a ship or any other property in danger in navigable or other waters. **A ship (vessel)** is defined as any ship, craft, or device capable of navigation. **Property** refers to any property not permanently and intentionally attached to the shoreline, including freight at risk (if not prepaid). _The Convention on Salvage_ 1989 applies whenever legal or arbitral proceedings related to its subject matter are conducted in a state party to _the Convention_. It does not apply to offshore drilling platforms and equipment, which are subject to their own specific salvage plans and procedures. Furthermore, it does not apply to warships and public vessels, unless a state party decides to extend its national regulations to include them, in which case the Secretary-General must be notified. However, the provisions of _the Convention_ do apply to salvage services rendered by warships or public vessels.

_The Convention on Salvage_, 1989 includes specific provisions regarding **the duties of the involved parties**. These duties apply to the salvor, the shipowner, and the ship's master. In prescribing these duties, _the Convention_ makes no distinction between _contractual_ and _spontaneous (non-contractual)_ salvage operations.

The salvor has the following duties:

- to exercise due care during the salvage operation;
- to apply such care to prevent or minimize environmental damage;
- to seek assistance from other salvors if circumstances require;
- to accept assistance from other salvors when reasonably requested by the owner of the property in danger, with the understanding that the amount of the salvage reward will not be affected if it is later determined that the request was unreasonable.

The shipowner, operator, master, or owner of other property in danger have the following duties toward the salvor:

- to cooperate with the salvor during the salvage operation;
- to exercise due care to prevent or minimize environmental damage;
- to accept delivery of the salvaged property once it has been brought to a place of safety, if the salvor reasonably requests it.

**A reward for salvage** is owed only for a successful outcome of the salvage operation. Success in the salvage action is a constitutive element of salvage, which, as a classical principle of salvage law, also characterizes modern salvage law. The principle of _no cure - no pay_ has been largely accepted as a primary feature of salvage in maritime law and was the fundamental principle of the 1910 _Convention on Salvage_, as well as the 1989 _Convention_. It has also been adopted in many standard salvage contracts, the most notable and widely accepted of which is the LOF (Lloyd's Open Form), featuring a clause explicitly named _No cure - No pay_. The reward is determined based on several criteria, particularly **the value of the property** salvaged. It logically follows that a salvor has no right to a reward if they fail to salvage at least some part of the property, regardless of their efforts and resources invested. Exceptionally, the salvor will be entitled to a reward even without a beneficial result if the damage incurred is attributable to the fault of the salvaged vessel (or its responsible parties).

Notwithstanding the outlined principles of salvage law, the parties are always free to agree upon a reward irrespective of the outcome.

When determining the salvage reward, the following **criteria** are taken into consideration:

- the value of the salvaged vessel and other salvaged property,
- the skill and efforts of the salvor in preventing or reducing damage to the marine environment,
- the degree of success achieved by the salvor,
- the nature and degree of danger,
- the skill and efforts of the salvor in rescuing persons, the vessel, and other property,
- the time spent, expenses incurred, and losses suffered by the salvor,
- the risk of liability and other risks faced by the salvor or their equipment,
- the speed at which the service was provided,
- the availability and use of vessels and other equipment intended for salvage operations,
- the readiness, efficiency, and value of the salvor's equipment.

The right to a salvage reward can be claimed through a court or arbitration. In addition to the reward, the salvor is entitled to claim interest on the reward and the costs of court or arbitration proceedings, which are recognized in their actual amount and are not limited to the value of the salvaged property. According to _the Convention on Salvage,_ 1989 the court may, at the request of a party, annul or modify a salvage contract for a vessel or other property, either in whole or in part, if the contract was concluded under undue influence or under the influence of danger, resulting in unfair terms. Additionally, the court may act if a party was induced to enter into the contract through fraud or intentional concealment of facts, or if the agreed reward is excessively high or excessively low in comparison to the services provided. If the court exercises its authority to amend a provision of the salvage contract regarding the amount of the reward, it will determine the reward by applying the prescribed criteria as if the parties had not agreed on the amount of the reward.

_The_ _Convention on Salvage,_ 1989 also prescribes negative criteria under which the salvor may lose their right to a reward, either in whole or in part:

- the salvor undertook the salvage of a vessel or other property against the explicit and reasonable prohibition of the master, owner, or operator of the salvaged vessel;
- the salvor, through their own fault, caused the need for salvage or made the salvage operation more difficult through negligence;
- the salvor committed theft, concealment, or fraudulent acts during the salvage operation.

The general principle is that the reward for salvage must be paid by the vessel in danger and other property interests that have been saved. This means that the owner of the salvaged property is obligated to contribute to the salvage reward. It is not necessary for this to involve ownership rights in the sense of real property law. This can include a time charterer in a ship charter contract, as well as any other person who has an interest in the salvaged property. The person obligated to pay the salvage reward is also required to provide a **guarantee** for the payment of the reward, including interest and costs. The salvor has a statutory lien on the vessel and on goods loaded aboard the vessel for the collection of claims related to the salvage reward -- **a maritime lien** under the 1993 _International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to Maritime Liens and Mortgages_.

Despite the right to maritime privilege, obtaining the appropriate guarantee, under the threat of retaining the salvaged property, is now the customary way to protect the interests of the salvor.

The distribution of the salvage reward between the owner, master, and crew members is determined according to the national regulations of the flag state of the salvor's vessel. If the salvage was not performed from a vessel, the distribution will be made according to the law applicable to the contract between the salvor and their officers.

In order to encourage salvors to participate in the protection of the marine environment during salvage operations, _the_ _Convention_ _on_ _Salvage_, 1989 introduces the right of the salvor to a so-called **_special compensation_**. The salvor is entitled to this compensation if two cumulative conditions are met:

- the salvaged vessel or its cargo posed a threat to the environment, and
- the salvor did not receive a salvage reward based on the prescribed criteria (e.g., they did not save property that would serve as a basis for determining the reward).
  If these two conditions are met, the determination of the amount of special compensation depends on two possible situations:
- If the salvage action _did not_ prevent or reduce environmental damage, the salvor is entitled to special compensation only for the actual costs incurred;
- If the salvage action _did_ prevent or reduce environmental damage, the court may increase the actual costs by 30% when determining the special compensation and may further increase the special compensation by up to 100% of the salvor's costs.

Once the special compensation has been determined, it must be compared with the standard salvage reward to establish the right to its payment. Specifically, the right to special compensation exists only if it is, and to the extent that it is, greater than the salvage reward. Therefore, if the reward (as determined by Article 13 of the _Convention_) is greater than the special compensation (as determined by Article 14 of the _Convention_), the salvor is not entitled to the special compensation. The special compensation is owed by the owner of the salvaged vessel, which practically means the P&I club to which the vessel is registered. The salvor may be fully or partially deprived of the right to special compensation if, due to negligence, they failed to prevent or reduce the environmental damage.

The salvage reward determined according to the criteria of Article 13 of the _Convention_ is recognized as part of a general average. In contrast, the special compensation determined by Article 14 of the Convention is not recognized in a general average because the cost incurred for environmental protection is not considered an expense for general salvage, which is a key element of general average.

Additionally, the salvage reward is a loss covered by the vessel's insurance, while the special compensation is not reimbursed through the vessel's standard insurance, because that cost was not incurred for the salvage of the vessel. However, special compensation is considered a loss covered by P&I (Protection and Indemnity) insurance, as it is related to the prevention of pollution, and the shipowner's liability for marine pollution is covered under P&I insurance.

_The_ _Convention on Salvage,_ 1989 explicitly states that no salvage reward is owed for saving **human lives**, unless otherwise provided by national regulations. Although the salvage of persons and property is inseparable in practice, there are significant legal differences, as the salvage of persons falls under the category of compulsory salvage, while, in principle (except in the case of vessel collisions), there is no obligation to salvage property. The rescue of people is a personal duty of the vessel's master, and the general rule is that no reward is given for saving human lives. Exceptionally, if both persons and property were saved in the same operation, the salvor of human lives is entitled to a portion of the salvage reward.

The master of a vessel is obliged to assist any person in danger at sea, provided that it is possible to do so without serious risk to the vessel and the people on board. According to the _SOLAS Convention_, the master's duty also extends to rescuing an enemy in armed conflict who is in danger at sea or missing at sea. There are certain exceptions to these strict duties of the master. The master is not obliged to proceed with a rescue or act to save persons in danger if:

- the rescue would pose serious danger to the vessel he commands and the persons on board;
- he reasonably believes that, given the specific circumstances of the case, the rescue would not be successful;
- he learns that another vessel has been selected to aid and that vessel has accepted the task;
- he is informed by the master of the endangered vessel, or directly from the persons in danger, or from the master of another vessel that has reached the individuals, that assistance is no longer required.

## Lloyd's Standard Form of Salvage Agreement (LOF 2000)

_The Lloyd's Standard Form of Salvage Agreement_ (Lloyd's Open Form -- LOF) is a British standardized contract form for salvage operations, widely used in global practice, and is the most well-known autonomous legal source in the field of maritime salvage law. The principle of no cure - no pay is fundamental and universally accepted in all editions of the LOF. With occasional revisions, this form has been in use for over a century. Throughout the 20th century, the LOF form was revised numerous times, aligning it with the modern demands of global shipping. Over time, LOF has gained widespread adoption, largely due to the security it provides to the parties involved, its established criteria, and the reputation of **Lloyd's arbitration**, which is agreed upon through the LOF contract.

Currently, the LOF 2000 form is in use, along with the latest revisions from 2011 and 2020, though the most significant changes to the form were introduced with the LOF 1980 edition. It was at this time that the fundamental _no cure - no pay_ principle was modified for the first time in the history of the LOF, in the interest of environmental protection, by adopting _a safety net_ provision. Under this provision, salvors were entitled to compensation for covering the costs of salvage even if no beneficial result was achieved in salvaging property, as long as they were involved in preventing pollution. If they prevented pollution, they were entitled to a coverage increase of up to 15% of the salvage costs. _The Convention on Salvage_, 1989 inspired by the safety net provision, established the right of salvors to special compensation when they participate in the prevention of marine environmental pollution (Article 14).

The **LOF 2000** form replaced the earlier LOF 1995 form. The LOF 2000 is more concise, consisting of only two pages, compared to the longer LOF 1995, which contained six pages. The International Salvage Union has regarded it as a significant advancement over previous versions, as it features clear and easily understandable language. Additionally, the LOF 2000 includes numerous innovations that facilitate salvage operations and the process of obtaining salvage rewards for salvors. Like its predecessors, the LOF 2000 retains the _no cure - no pay_ principle.

By signing the LOF 2000 form, the contractual relationship is governed by English law. The parties to the salvage contract are the salvor and the owner of the property in danger, referred to in the form as the _Contractor_ and the _Owner_. A shipowner, if not the vessel's owner, may also be a party to the contract. The shipowner can enter into a salvage agreement on their own behalf or on behalf of the owner of other property on the vessel, in which case they act as the representative of that person, with their authority based either on a power of attorney, authorization in the contract, or law.

For the conclusion of the LOF 2000 contractual form, as well as for previous versions, the following parties are authorized: the master of the endangered vessel and the master of the vessel providing assistance, the owner of the endangered vessel and the owner of the assisting vessel, the owners of cargo seeking to salvage their cargo, and the master or owner of the endangered vessel acting on behalf of the owner of other property on board (cargo, bunker, supplies, freight if at risk). Personal belongings of the master, crew members, and passengers (including automobiles accompanying passengers) are excluded from the salvage reward.

The salvor (_Contractor_ in the LOF form) undertakes by this agreement to make every effort not only to salvage property but also to simultaneously prevent or reduce environmental damage. In contemporary practice, the salvage reward is very rarely agreed upon in advance; therefore, newer versions of the LOF form, including the 2000 version, do not include a field for specifying the reward amount. The amount of the salvage reward, as well as any special compensation, is determined by arbitration in London based on criteria identical to those set forth in _the Convention on Salvage,_ 1989 and specified in _Lloyd's Standard Salvage and Arbitration Clauses (LSSA clauses)_ and _Lloyd's Procedural Rules_. The provisions of the LSSA clauses and the Lloyd's Procedural Rules are an integral part of the contract. The provisions of the LOF 2000 form apply to salvage services performed by the salvor prior to the conclusion of the agreement.

The owner of the endangered vessel and the crew members of that vessel are obligated to fully cooperate with the salvors, and the salvor has the right, without additional charges, to reasonably use the vessel's machinery, devices, equipment, and supplies during the salvage operation. After the salvage service has been completed, the salvor must notify the value of the guarantee sought from each individual property interest (the owner of the vessel, cargo, and other property). Before the cargo is handed over, the cargo owner is obligated to provide a proportional guarantee to the vessel owner for their share of the salvage reward. In the event that the salvage operation does not yield a useful result, but there was a risk of pollution, the owner of the endangered vessel is obliged to provide the salvor with a guarantee for the special compensation, as defined in Article 14 of _the Convention on Salvage_. The currency of the salvage reward and special compensation is expressed in US dollars.

Once a guarantee has been provided, or upon request of the parties, _the Lloyd's Council_ will appoint an individual arbitrator. A party dissatisfied with the arbitration decision may file an appeal to the Council. The Council will then appoint a special arbitrator to resolve the appeal. The decision of this arbitrator in the arbitration process is final.

The salvor has a maritime lien on the salvaged property until a guarantee for the payment of the salvage reward is provided. Without the salvor's consent, it is prohibited to remove the salvaged property from the location where the salvage operation was completed. The guarantee must be provided by a party acceptable to the salvor or to _the Lloyd's Council_. If the _Council_ decides on the acceptability of the guarantee, the guarantor must have its registered office in the United Kingdom.

When there is no longer a reasonable prospect of a beneficial result, based on which a salvage reward is due according to Article 13 of _the Convention on Salvage_, 1989 the owner of the vessel or the salvor, under LOF 2000, has the right to terminate the salvage services by giving written notice to the other party.

The LOF form specifies when the salvage services are considered to have been completed, defining the conditions under which the salvaged property is deemed to have been brought to a safe place in a secure condition, ready for return to the owner. This can be of crucial importance in the final stages of a salvage operation.

As an addition to the LOF 2000 form, the so-called _SCOPIC clause_ is printed, which is applied by mutual agreement alongside the LOF 2000 form. It is an optional provision that may, but does not have to, be used. By incorporating the _SCOPIC clause_, which consists of a special tariff system for compensating salvors, the special compensation defined in Article 14 of _the_ _Convention on Salvage,_ 1989is excluded from the contract.

## Special Compensation of Protecting and Indemnity Clause (SCOPIC)

The relative failure of the Convention's solution to further incentivize salvors for environmental protection through the right to special compensation has led professional salvors and Protection and Indemnity (P&I) clubs (as liability insurers who pay special compensation) to develop and offer a special tariff system for determining compensation, known as the **_SCOPIC clause_** _(Special Compensation of Protecting and Indemnity Clause)._ This clause was added to the LOF 2000 form in such a way that its inclusion is an option, which may, but does not have to, be used alongside the LOF form.

The characteristic of the _SCOPIC clause_ is that it provides salvors with greater certainty in securing such compensation, compared to special compensation, and offers P.&I. clubs the opportunity to oversee the salvage operation.

This clause determines the compensation according to predefined and agreed-upon criteria, and by incorporating _the SCOPIC clause_, the application of Article 14 (special compensation) of _the Convention on Salvage_ is excluded. Salvors can invoke _the_ _SCOPIC clause_ at any stage of the salvage operation, provided certain conditions are met, regardless of whether the environment is at risk or not. The special compensation assessed in accordance with the SCOPIC clause is referred to as **_SCOPIC compensation_**. By incorporating _the_ _SCOPIC clause_, the salvor ensures that they will be paid the specified _SCOPIC compensation_ by the owner of the vessel or their P.&I. club. According to this clause, the salvor may also recover their cash expenses.

Regardless of the inclusion of _the SCOPIC clause_, the salvage award is determined according to the criteria set out in Article 13 of _the_ _Convention on Salvage,_ 1989 and the compensation under _the_ _SCOPIC clause_ is paid only if it exceeds the salvage award. If the compensation under _the SCOPIC clause_ is lower, the salvage award is reduced by 25% of the difference between the salvage award and the compensation determined under _the SCOPIC clause._ The salvor may cease performing salvage services if the amounts they are entitled to exceed the value of the property that can be saved, as well as all the amounts to which they would be entitled under _the SCOPIC clause_.

By contracting _the SCOPIC clause_, the salvor ensures that they will receive compensation in the agreed amount solely from the shipowner or their P&I club, and will obtain the appropriate guarantee provided by the P&I club to which the vessel is affiliated. The assessment of _the SCOPIC compensation_ begins from the moment a written notice is sent to the vessel's owners, and services provided prior to this written notice will not be compensated under _the SCOPIC clause_, but rather in accordance with Article 13 of _the Convention on Salvage_, 1989 as stipulated _in the main contract_. Unlike the salvage award, both the special compensation (as defined in Article 14 of _the Convention_) and _the SCOPIC compensation_ are not recognized in general average.

Upon receiving the written notice from the salvor, and referencing _the SCOPIC clause,_ the shipowners must provide the salvor with a bank guarantee or a P&I club guarantee (referred to as _the initial security_) within 2 working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays recognized by Lloyd's). The guarantee must meet the salvor's satisfaction and secure their claim for _the_ _SCOPIC compensation_ in the amount of 3 million USD, including interest and costs.

_The SCOPIC clause_ allows the salvor to be reimbursed for the costs of personnel and equipment used during the salvage operation. These costs are reimbursed according to a specified tariff, which is included in the annex of the LOF 2000 form, with an additional bonus of 25% of the predetermined rates. Furthermore, the salvor may be reimbursed for reasonable cash expenses incurred during the salvage operation. The assessment of _SCOPIC compensation_ includes the prevention and removal of pollution in the immediate vicinity of the vessel, if necessary for the proper execution of the salvage.

If the shipowners fail to provide the initial security within the specified 2 working days, the salvor, at their discretion, and by notifying the shipowners, has the right to withdraw from all provisions of _the SCOPIC clause_ and to exercise their rights under the main contract, including Article 14, which will apply as if _the SCOPIC clause_ did not exist.

The SCOPIC clause allows the shipowner to appoint an independent representative (_Shipowner's Casualty Representative - SCR_) to attend the salvage operation. The appointed representative (SCR) is tasked with monitoring the salvage operation to prevent the incurrence of unnecessary costs or expenses by the salvor, with the aim of securing _the_ _SCOPIC compensation_. Special representatives may also be appointed by other interested parties, such as cargo owners and insurers. The salvor's shipmaster is required to send daily reports about the salvage operation to Lloyd's and to the shipowner until the SCR arrives on board, and thereafter to the SCR.

When salvage operations are conducted under _the SCOPIC clause_, the duties and responsibilities of the parties regarding pollution prevention remain as prescribed in the main contract. Thus, the salvor is obligated to take all necessary steps to save the ship and other property aboard and thereby prevent or minimize environmental damage.

Any dispute arising from _the SCOPIC clause_ shall be resolved by arbitration as provided in the main contract.
