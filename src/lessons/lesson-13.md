Convention of the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention -LDC-):

## Aims of the Convention:

- **Art. I:** Parties shall individually and collectively promote the effective control of all sources of pollution of the marine environment, and pledge themselves especially to take all practicable steps to prevent the pollution of the sea by the dumping of waste and other matter that is liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.
- **Art. II:** Parties shall take effective measures individually, according to their scientific, technical and economic capabilities, and collectively, to prevent marine pollution caused by dumping and shall harmonize their policies in this regard.

## Definitions (Art. III):

- _Dumping _(Art. III.1.a)_:_ (i) any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea; (ii) any deliberate disposal at sea of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other manmade structures at sea.
  _"Dumping" does not include (Art. III.1.b_): (i) the disposal at sea of wastes or other matter incidental to, or derived from the normal operations of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea and their equipment, other than wastes or other matter transported by or to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, operating for the purpose of disposal of such matter or derived from the treatment of such wastes or other matter on such vessels, aircraft, platforms or structures; (ii) placement of matter for a purpose other than the mere disposal thereof, provided that such placement is not contrary to the aims of this Convention.
  _Exclusions of the Convention (Art. III.1.c):_ The disposal of wastes or other matter directly arising from, or related to the exploration, exploitation and associated off-shore processing of sea-bed mineral resources will not be covered by the provisions of this Convention.
- **Wastes or other matter (Art. III.4)**: means material and substance of any kind, form or description.
- **Special permit (Art. III.5)** :means permission granted specifically on application in advance and in accordance with Annex II and Annex III.
- **General permit (Art. III.6):** means permission granted in advance and in accordance with Annex III.

**Provisions regarding the dumping of wastes (Art. IV):** In accordance with the provisions of the Convention Contracting Parties shall prohibit the dumping of any wastes or other matter in whatever form or condition except as otherwise specified below: (a) the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in Annex I is prohibited; (b) the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in Annex II requires a prior special permit; (c) the dumping of all other wastes or matter requires a prior general permit.

Any permit shall be issued only after careful consideration of all the factors set forth in Annex III, including prior studies of the characteristics of the dumping site, as set forth in sections B and C of that Annex.

No provision of the Convention is to be interpreted as preventing a Contracting Party from prohibiting, insofar as that Party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not mentioned in Annex I.

**Exceptions to the rule set in art. IV (Art. V):** The provisions of article IV shall not apply when it is necessary to secure the safety of human life or of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in cases of force majeure caused by stress of weather, or in any case which constitutes a danger to human life or a real threat to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, if dumping appears to be the only way of averting the threat and if there is every probability that the damage consequent upon such dumping will be less than would otherwise occur. Such dumping shall be so conducted as to minimize the likelihood of damage to human or marine life and shall be reported forthwith to the Organization.

A Contracting Party may issue a special permit as an exception to article IV(1)(a), in emergencies, posing unacceptable risk relating to human health and admitting no other feasible solution. Before doing so the Party shall consult any other country or countries that are likely to be affected and the Organization which, after consulting other Parties, and international organizations as appropriate, shall, in accordance with article XIV promptly recommend to the Party the most appropriate procedures to adopt.

**Regulation on the incineration of wastes at sea (Annex I -art. 10-):** The amendments to Annex I and II to the Convention, 1972, added that incineration at sea of industrial waste and sewage sludge is prohibited while the incineration at sea of any other wastes or other matter requires the issue of a special permit.

**The role of the appropriate authority of a Contracting Party (Art. VI):** Each Contracting Party shall designate an appropriate authority or authorities to: (a) issue special permits which shall be required prior to, and for, the dumping of matter listed in Annex II and in the circumstances provided for in article V(2); (b) issue general permits which shall be required prior to, and for, the dumping of all other matter; (c) keep records of the nature and quantities of all matter permitted to be dumped and the location, time and method of dumping (...).

The appropriate authority or authorities of a contracting Party shall issue prior special or general permits in respect of matter intended for dumping: (a) loaded in its territory; (b) loaded by a vessel or aircraft registered in its territory or flying its flag, when the loading occurs in the territory of a State not party to this Convention.

**London Protocol:** In 1996, Parties adopted a Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (known as the London Protocol) which entered into force in 2006.The Protocol, which is meant to eventually replace the 1972 Convention, represents a major change of approach to the question of how to regulate the use of the sea as a depository for waste materials. Rather than stating which materials may not be dumped, it prohibits all dumping, except for possibly acceptable wastes on the so-called "reverse list", contained in an annex to the Protocol. Currently there are 53 Parties to the Protocol.

International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969:

**Rights of Parties to the Convention (Art. I.1):** Parties may take such measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from pollution or threat of pollution of the sea by oil; following upon a maritime casualty or acts related to such a casualty, which may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences.

Exclusion (Art. I.2): no measures shall be taken against any warship or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government noncommercial services.

## Definitions (Art. II):

The coastal State shall take into account any views they may submit;
(c) Before any measure is taken, the coastal State may proceed to a consultation with independent experts, whose names shall be chosen from a list maintained by the Organizations;
(d) In cases of extreme urgency requiring measures to be taken immediately, the coastal State may take measures rendered necessary by the urgency of the situation, without prior notification or consultation or without continuing consultations already begun;
(e) A coastal State shall, before taking such measures and during their course, use its best endeavors to avoid any risk to human life, and to afford persons in distress any assistance of which they may stand in need, and in appropriate cases to facilitate the repatriation of ships' crews, and to raise no obstacle thereto;
(f) Measures which have been taken in application of Article I shall be notified without delay to the States and to the known physical or corporate persons concerned, as well as to the Secretary-General of the Organization.

Measures taken by the coastal State shall be proportionate to the damage actual or threatened to it. Such measures shall not go beyond what is reasonably necessary to achieve the end mentioned in Article I and shall cease as soon as that end has been achieved; they shall not unnecessarily interfere with the rights and interests of the flag State, third States and of any persons, physical or corporate, concerned.

- **Right to compensation (Art. VI):**

Any Party which has taken measures according the provisions of the Convention causing damage to others, shall be obliged to pay compensation to the extent of the damage caused by measures which exceed those reasonably necessary to achieve the end mentioned in Article I.

** Implications of the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Pollution by Substances other than Oil, 1973:**

- **Rights of Parties to the Protocol (Art. I.1):** Parties may take such measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from pollution or threat of pollution by substances other than oil following upon a maritime casualty or acts related to such a casualty, which may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences.

## Definitions (Art. I.2):

- "_Substances other than oil"_: (a) those substances enumerated in a list which shall be established by an appropriate body designated by the Organization and which shall be annexed to the present Protocol, and (b) those other substances which are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea (Party shall have the burden of establishing that the substance, under the circumstances present at the time of the intervention, could reasonably pose a grave and imminent danger).

- **Provisions regarding the intervention (Art. II):**

- The provisions of paragraph 2 of Article I and of Articles II to VIII of the Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, and the Annex thereto as they relate to oil, shall be applicable with regard to the substances referred to in Article I of the present Protocol.

- \**Owner: *person or persons registered as the owner of the ship or, in the absence of registration, the person or persons owning the ship. However in the case of a ship owned by a State and operated by a company which in that State is registered as the ship's operator, "owner" shall mean such company.
- _Oil_: any persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil, whether carried on board a ship as cargo or in the bunkers of such a ship.
- _Pollution damage: _(a) loss or damage caused outside the ship by contamination resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from the ship, wherever such escape or discharge may occur, provided that compensation for impairment of the environment other than loss of profit from such impairment shall be limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken; (b) the costs of preventive measures and further loss or damage caused by preventive measures.

**Exclusion clause (Art. I.4):** No claim for compensation for pollution damage may be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention.

For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of limitation the owner shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX or, if no action is brought, with any Court or other competent authority in any one of the Contracting States in which an action can be brought under Article IX.

**Exception to the rule of liability (Art. V.2):** The owner shall not be entitled to limit his liability under the Convention if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.

**Insurance or other financial security (Art. VII.1):** The owner of a ship registered in a Contracting State and carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or a certificate delivered by an international compensation fund, in the sums fixed by applying the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1 to cover his liability for pollution damage under the Convention.

**Issuance of the Certificate (Art. VII.2):** A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of the Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a Contracting State has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with.

With respect to a ship registered in a Contracting State such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a Contracting State it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any Contracting State.
