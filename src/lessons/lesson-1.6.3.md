**For seafarers,** as a special category of employees, the workplace is also their place of residence, and their living and working conditions differ greatly from those of employees in other economic sectors based on land. These specific conditions have led to the adoption of the largest number of conventions of **International Labour Organization** (ILO) in relation to seafarers' work. Seafarers' employment relationships are a unique case among employment relationships in general. Through the _Joint Maritime Commission_ and special maritime sessions of the _International Labour Conference_ within the ILO framework, a large number of conventions and recommendations have been adopted to regulate seafarers' working conditions. Draft conventions are voted on by the _International Labour Conference_, and the text becomes binding for a country once it is ratified and reported to the appropriate ILO bodies.

The greatest achievement in terms of labour relations in the maritime sector was the adoption of the **_Maritime Labour Convention_**, **2006** (MLC). Based on Article 19 of the Constitution, _the Convention_ was adopted at the 94th session of the ILO held from February 7 to 23, 2006, in Geneva, as a result of a tripartite agreement among governments, seafarers' unions, and shipowners' representatives. _The Convention_ came into force in August 2013 (twelve months after it was ratified by 30 countries with at least 33% of the world's gross tonnage). _The Convention_ provides comprehensive protection of the fundamental rights of all seafarers, regardless of their nationality or the flag state of the ship.

It was adopted to further enhance the status and improve **the working, living, and social rights of seafarers**. Under the _Convention_, every seafarer is entitled to a safe and secure workplace that meets safety standards, fair terms of employment, decent working and living conditions on board, healthcare, medical assistance, measures for improving living and working conditions, and other forms of social protection. Additionally, _the Convention_ helps create conditions for fair competition among shipowners. It is intended to be globally and uniformly applicable, easy to understand, and capable of being readily amended and supplemented.

_The Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 has two main purposes:

- ­to bring the protection system contained in existing seafarers' labour standards closer in line with the rapidly evolving, globalised maritime sector (ensuring _decent work_);
- to improve the applicability of the system so that shipowners and governments committed to providing decent working conditions do not bear an unequal burden in ensuring protection (creating a level playing field in market competition).

_The Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 is considered _the fourth pillar_ of quality shipping, complementing the key IMO conventions: _The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 as amended_ (SOLAS), _the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers,_ 1978 (STCW)_,_ and _the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,_ 1973/78 (MARPOL)_. The Maritime Labour Convention_ is also referred to as _the Seafarers' Bill of Rights._

_The Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006represents a **consolidation and modernization** of standards defined in as many as 68 instruments (37 conventions and 31 recommendations) previously adopted within the ILO framework. _The Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 does not include _Convention No. 71_ _on Seafarers' Pensions_ from 1946 and _Convention No. 108 on Seafarers' Identity Documents_ from 1958. Existing ILO conventions on maritime labour will gradually be phased out as ILO member states, that ratified these conventions, ratify the _Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006. However, there will be a transitional period during which some parallel conventions will still be in force. Countries that ratify the _Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 will no longer be bound by existing conventions once the new _Convention_ takes effect, while countries that do not ratify the new _Convention_ will remain bound by the conventions they previously ratified, although those conventions will be closed to further ratification*.*

Without introducing fundamentally new requirements, the _Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 enables more effective enforcement of prescribed standards compared to previous ILO conventions through the specified obligations of flag states and port state inspections. Member state authorities may inspect working conditions on ships from states that have not ratified _the Convention_.

For the purposes of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, Article II defines the following terms: seafarer, ship, shipowner, competent authority, Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance, Maritime Labour Certificate, seafarers' employment agreement, and seafarer recruitment and placement service.

**A seafarer **is any person who is employed, engaged, or works in any capacity on a ship to which _the Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 applies. The definition of a seafarer was adopted with the clear intention that anyone working at sea should be covered by the protection provided by _the Convention_. In cases of doubt as to whether a particular group of people should be considered seafarers under _the Convention_, the competent authority of a member state will decide after consulting with shipowners' and seafarers' organizations interested in the matter.

**A ship** refers to a vessel, except those operating exclusively in internal waters or in waters within or very near to port areas or areas where port regulations apply. _The Convention_ applies to all ships, whether publicly or privately owned, that are regularly engaged in commercial activities, with the exception of fishing or similar vessels, and traditional vessels such as dhows (traditional sailing ships of the Persian Gulf and the western Indian Ocean) and junks (traditional sailing vessels of the South China Sea). _The Convention_ does not apply to warships and auxiliary warships. In cases of doubt regarding the application of _the Convention_ to a specific ship or group of ships, the competent authority of the member state will decide after consulting with the interested shipowners' and seafarers' organizations.

**Shipowner** refers to the owner of the ship or any other organization or person, such as a company, agent, or bareboat charterer, who has assumed responsibility for the operation of the ship from the owner and, by assuming such responsibility, agrees to take on the duties and obligations of the shipowner in accordance with _the Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006, regardless of whether another organization or person is fulfilling certain duties or obligations on behalf of the shipowner.

_The competent authority_ includes the minister, government department, or other authority that is authorised to make and enforce rules, orders, or other directives that have the force of law with respect to matters covered by the provisions.

**A seafarers' employment agreement** includes an employment contract and a crew member's engagement contract, while a seafarer recruitment and placement service refer to any person, company, institution, agency, or other organization, either public or private, engaged in recruiting seafarers on behalf of the shipowner or in facilitating the placement of seafarers between seafarers and shipowners.

Furthermore, _the special tripartite committee_ of the ILO is a committee of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, which has specific responsibilities in the field of seafarers' labour standards. It consists of two representatives appointed by the government of each member state that has ratified the _Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006, and representative of shipowners and seafarers appointed by the Governing Body after consultation with the Joint Maritime Commission.

Each member state must ensure that ships flying its flag (of 500 GT or more) have a **_Maritime Labour Certificate_** and a **_Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance_**. Certificates confirming compliance with the working conditions under _the Convention_ are issued by the flag state of the ship. On board, there must also be a visible certificate of compulsory insurance or other financial security provided by the shipowner to cover the costs of the crew members' return travel or to provide compensation for damage caused by illness, injury, or death of a crew member.

**The flag state** is obligated to supervise ships under its nationality, while **the port state** has the right to conduct inspections to check if the ship holds the appropriate certificate and if the conditions on board comply with the provisions of _the Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006. If the ship does not meet these conditions, the port state has the right to detain the ship. The port state inspection applies to all ships over 500 gross tons, regardless of whether their flag state has ratified _the Convention_.

_The Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 is structured similarly to the practice used by the IMO for its instruments, combining binding norms and recommendations into a single act. _The MLC_ consists of, in addition to the preamble, Articles, Regulations, and the Code. The Articles represent general principles and obligations. The Regulations and Code contain more detailed provisions and are divided into five chapters: _Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship, Conditions of employment, Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering, Health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection_, and _Compliance and enforcement_. The Regulations contain fundamental rights and principles, as well as the core obligations of _the Convention_, while the Code provides details on the implementation of the Regulations. Part A of the Code (Standards) is compulsory, while Part B (Guidelines) contains recommendations that member states should consider when adopting national regulations to implement _the Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006.

The first chapter, titled **_Minimum Requirements for Seafarers to Work on a Ship_**, includes provisions on the minimum age for working on a ship, medical certificates, training and qualifications of seafarers, and the procedures for their recruitment.

The second chapter, **_Conditions of Employment_**, stipulates requirements regarding seafarers' employment contracts and salaries, working hours, rest hours, annual leave, repatriation, compensation in case of ship loss or sinking, minimum crew numbers, career advancement opportunities, and professional development.

The third chapter, **_Accommodation, Recreational Facilities, Food and Catering_**, contains detailed requirements for accommodation and recreational spaces on the ship (ventilation, heating, lighting, sleeping quarters, dining areas, sanitary facilities, medical care areas, rest areas, ship visits, etc.), as well as requirements for food and catering services.

The fourth chapter, titled **_Health Protection, Medical Care, Welfare and Safety_**, sets standards for health protection, medical care for seafarers both on board and ashore, shipowner responsibilities for work-related illnesses or accidents, accident prevention, and social protection.

The final, fifth chapter, titled **_Compliance and Enforcement_**, contains provisions on the responsibility of the flag state, the port state that the ship calls, and the responsibility of the state that provides the labour market.

Between the articles and chapters, there is an interpretative note on the **_Rules and Code_**, which is not part of _the Convention_ but is intended to provide further information and assistance, especially to Governments about the relationship between parts in the Code.

According to Article 19 of the ILO Constitution (and Article XIV of _the Convention_), the Articles and Rules can only be amended or supplemented through the procedure prescribed for adopting conventions. However, the Code can be amended through a simplified procedure established in Article XV of _the Convention_. Since the Code refers to more detailed implementation, its amendments must remain within the general framework of the Articles and Rules.

_The Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006 has been amended four times according to Article XV, specifically in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2022. The most significant amendments occurred in 2014, as they were the first to address, through compulsory international legislation, the situation of abandoned seafarers. Additionally, these amendments clarified the flag state's obligations regarding mandatory financial guarantees (mandatory liability insurance) that its ships must carry. Other amendments focused on eliminating harassment and abuse on board, regulating the rights of seafarers in cases of captivity due to piracy, strengthening legal requirements for seafarers' access to medical care on land, and establishing the right to mandatory social connectivity for seafarers, including access to free internet on board.

The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 occasionally introduces new topics to existing ILO maritime labour conventions, particularly in the area of occupational safety and health. These updates meet current health concerns, such as the effects of noise and vibration on workers or other workplace risks.

The standards in the Convention are not lower than those of existing maritime labour ones. Its aim is to maintain the standards in the current maritime labour Conventions at the present level while granting each country greater discretion in formulating national laws to achieve the required level of protection.

For ships of ratifying countries, the Convention offers several advantages. It ensures decent working conditions for seafarers, protects them against unfair competition from substandard ships, and benefits shipowners by providing a certification system. This system helps reduce or avoid lengthy delays due to inspections in foreign ports.

The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 aims to establish a continuous "compliance awareness" at all levels, from national protection systems to the international system. It enhances compliance and enforcement, starting with the **individual seafarers**, who -- under the Convention -- have to be properly informed of their rights and the remedies available in cases of alleged non-compliance. The Convention also recognizes their right to file complaints both on board and ashore.

**Shipowners** also have responsibilities under the Convention. Owners or operators of ships of 500 gross tonnage and above engaged in international voyages or voyages between foreign ports must develop and implement plans to ensure compliance with national laws, regulations, or other measures implementing the Convention.

The **Masters** of these ships are responsible for carrying out the shipowners' stated plans, and keeping proper records to evidence implementation of the requirements of the Convention.

As part of its updated responsibilities for labour inspections on ships above 500 gross tonnage engaged in international voyages or voyages between foreign ports, the **flag State** (or a recognized organization on its behalf) will review the shipowners' plans and verify and certify that they are actually in place and being implemented. **Ships** will then be required to carry a maritime labour certificate and a declaration of maritime labour compliance on board.

### Compliance and Enforcement Structure

The _Maritime Labour Convention_, 2006, promotes continuous compliance awareness at all levels, from individual seafarers to shipowners, masters, flag states, and port states.

**Individual seafarers** must be informed of their rights and can make complaints about non-compliance on board and ashore. The Maritime Labour Convention recognized, among others, the following rights for seafarers: right to life, freedom of forced labour (ILO C 1939 (No. 29)), freedom from torture, cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment, freedom from discrimination, prohibition of child labour, right to a legal remedy and access to justice, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, right to employment agreement, right to free employment services and continuity of employment, right to identification documents and shore leave, right to safe and healthy working conditions, right to wages, right to reasonable working hours, hours of rest and holidays, right to health and medical care, right to social security and welfare, entitlement to leave and right to repatriation.

Repatriation includes the passage to the destination selected, accommodation and food from the moment the seafarer leaves the ship until he/she reaches the destination, pay and allowances, transportation and medical treatment when necessary.

**Shipowners** operating ships exceeding 500 gross tonnage and engaged in international or foreign voyages are required to develop and implement compliance plans. They must also maintain accurate records to demonstrate adherence to the standards set by the Maritime Labour Convention.

**Masters** are responsible for implementing the compliance plans and keeping records.

**Flag States** must review, verify, and certify compliance plans for ships above 500 gross tonnage, perform periodic inspections and issue certificates confirming that ships meet the Maritime Labour Convention standards, conduct quality assessments of their national compliance systems and submit reports to the ILO.

**Port States** may conductvoluntary inspectionsof foreign ships to ensure compliance, reinforcing the international oversight provided by the Maritime Labour Convention.

### Certification Documents: The Maritime Labour Certificate and Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance (DMLC)

The appendices to the Convention contain key model documents: a maritime labour certificate and a declaration of maritime labour compliance.

The **Maritime Labour Certificate** is issued by the flag state for ships that meet the Maritime Labour Convention standards. It is valid for five years, subject to periodic inspections. It verifies that working and living conditions on board comply with national laws and regulations aligned with the Maritime Labour Convention.

The **Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance** (DMLC) is **attached to the Certificate**. It summarizes the national laws implementing the Maritime Labour Organization standards across 14 key areas. It includes the Shipowner's plan for ensuring compliance between inspections.

### The 14 Key Compliance Areas in the DMLC

The list of the 14 areas that must be certified by the flag State and that may be inspected in foreign ports, if an inspection occurs, is outlined in the Appendices to the Convention as follows:

1.  **Minimum age requirements.** Employment, engagement or work of seafarers of any person under 16 years old is prohibited. Night work of seafarers under 16 years old is prohibited.
2.  **Medical certification.** All seafarers must hold a valid medical certificate prior to beginning work on a ship, without prejudice to the requirements of STCW. The medical certificate must be issued by a medical practitioner, and should have a maximum validity period of two years.
3.  **Qualifications of seafarers.** Seafarers should be trained or certified as competent or otherwise qualified to perform their duties. They should receive personal safety training, as well as training and certification in accordance with the STCW convention.
4.  **Seafarers' employment agreements.** Terms and conditions shall be set out or referred to in a clear written legally enforceable agreement and consistent with the Code. Seafarers should have the opportunity to review and seek advice and freely accept them before signing. They shall as well incorporate a collective bargaining agreement (CBA).
5.  **Use of private recruitment and placement services.** All seafarers must have access to an efficient and well-regulated seafarer recruitment and placement system. Recruitment and placement services shall comply with the standards set out in the Code. Member States shall require shipowners employing seafarers on ships flying their flag to ensure that recruitment and placement services, even if based in non-Convention countries, adhere to the Code's requirements.
6.  **Hours of work and rest.** The Maritime Labour Convention establishes a standard of 8 hours of work per day with one-day rest per week. The maximum hours of work are 14 hours in any 24-hour period and 72 hours in any seven-day period. The Convention also regulates the maximum hours of rest, establishing ten hours in any 24-hour period and 77 hours in any seven-day period. These hours of rest may be divided into no more than 2 periods, one of which shall be at least 6 hours in length. Drills must be conducted in a manner that minimizes disturbance of rest periods. A table with shipboard working arrangement should be posted in an accessible place. Records of seafarer's daily hours of work and hours of rest must be maintained. Nonetheless, the Master has the right to require seafarers who are necessary for the immediate safety of the ship, person on board or cargo or giving assistance.
7.  **Manning levels for safe operations.** Ships shall have a sufficient number of seafarers to ensure that ships are operated safely, efficiently and with due regard to security under all conditions, considering concerns about seafarers' fatigue.
8.  **Accommodation standards. **The size of rooms and other accommodation spaces shall be sufficient. Heating and ventilation shall be provided. Noise and vibration and other ambient factors shall be considered, and sanitary facilities provided, as well as adequate lighting. Vessels should provide a hospital accommodation on board.
9.  **On-board recreational facilities.** Vessels should be equipped with appropriate seafarers' recreational facilities, amenities and services, including social connectivity, all of the above adapted to meet the special needs of seafarers.
10. **Food and catering.** The convention establishes minimum standards for the quantity and quality of food and drinking water, according to the number of seafarers on board, religious requirements and cultural practices and the duration and nature of the voyage, considering the nutritional value and variety and hygienic conditions. Catering staff should be properly trained.
11. **Health and safety protection and accident prevention.** The Convention requires the effective implementation and promotion of occupational safety and health policies, considering reasonable precautions to prevent occupational accidents; as well as the implementation of on-board programmes for the prevention of occupational safety and health protection.
12. **On-board medical care.** The Maritime Labour Convention ensures that seafarers are provided with occupational health and protection, medical and dental care. Medical reports should be adopted for use by the ship's Masters and relevant onshore and on-board medical personnel, which ensures confidentiality. Ships shall be provided with and on-board hospital and medical care facilities and equipment on ships that fly its flag, comparable to those available to workers ashore, with seafarers having the right to visit a qualified doctor or dentist in ports of call. The Convention ensures that medical care and health protection services are provided free of charge to seafarers, and are not limited to treatment of sick or injured seafarers but include measures of a preventive character such as health promotion and health education programmes. Shipowners shall bear the cost of sickness and injury, assure a compensation in the event of death and/or long-term disability, as well as cover the cost of burial expenses.
13. **On-board complaint procedures.** Seafarers are entitled to lodge a complaint on board the ship in case of non-compliance with legal dispositions, regulations or agreements made under the Convention. A complaint procedure shall be made available on board by the shipowner. Seafarers lodging a complaint may be accompanied or represented during the procedure. The complaint system must include safeguards against victimisation. Complaints shall be resolved at the lowest possible level.
14. **Payment of wages.** Wages must be made no greater than at monthly intervals. A monthly account of payment must be given. The Convention also requires the adoption of measures to ensure that wages are transmitted to their families.
